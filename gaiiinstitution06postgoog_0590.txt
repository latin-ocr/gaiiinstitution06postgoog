ita post bonorum quoque possessionem ejus, sive ipse sui sive alius
defensionem ejus suscipiat, debet satisdare, ut satisdatione interposita
judicium accipiatur et a possessione discedatur, Dig. 42, 5, 33, 1.
‘ Missio in possessionem is prevented by the appearance of a de-
fensor, and after bonorum possessio the debtor or a defensor may, on
giving· security judicatum solvi, defend the action, and put an end
to the possessio.' Quintius refused to give this security on the
ground that he had broken no vadimonium, and committed no act
of bankruptcy, and that his goods had consequently not been legally
possessed. The praetor directed a sponsio praejudicialis to try this
preliminary question: J ubet P. Quintium sponsionem cum Sexto
Naevio facere: Si bona sua ex edicto P. Burrieni praetoris dies tri-
ginta possessa non essent: and against the ordinary rule that a man
should not be required to prove a negative, made Quintius the
plaintiff in the sponsio, In the absence of Quintius, a friend had
appeared (voluntarius procurator), who volunteered to undertake his
defence, and thus prevent the missio in possessionem3 but he was
not allowed by the praetor, because he declined to enter into the
security judicatum solvi, Cicero, Pro Quintio.

Besides the forfeiture of a vadimonium, fraudulent absconding
to avoid the summons to appear was an act of bankruptcy, or
motive for missio in possessionem. Praetor ait: Qui fraudationis
causa latitabit, si honi viri arbitratu non defendetur, ejus bona pos-
sideri vendique Jubebo‚<Dig. 42, 4, ’7, 1. ‘ If a debtor fraudulently
abscond, and no sufficient representative defends him, 1 will order
his goods to be possessed and sold.’

A heres might, on cause shown to the praetor, immediately after
his entry on the successim, be required by the creditors to give
security for the payment of their claims, with the alternative of
seizure and sale, on the mere ground of poverty, ᾧ 102. But aster
a lapse of time it was necessary to prove not only poverty, but
fraudulent behaviour on the part of the heres, Dig. 42, 5, 31.

The stipulation judicatum solvi contained three clauses: J udi· ‘
catum solvi stipulatio tres clausulas in unum collatas habet: de re
judicata, de re defendenda, de dolo malo, Dig. 46, ⁷, 6. ‘ The
stipulation judicatum solvi is composed of three clauses, for satis-
faction of the judgment‚ for defending the action, and against
malicious deterioration in ease of restitution.' The action must
be defended ‘ to the satisfaction of a reasonable man,’ which was
interpreted to mean that, if a defensor appeared before the judex,
