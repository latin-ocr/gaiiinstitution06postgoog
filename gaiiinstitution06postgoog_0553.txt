praestare oporteret, quid virum uxori, quid uxorem viro, tradiderunt,
Topica, 17. ‘ Private suits of the highest importance turn on the
doctrines of the jurist. . . . In all the actions, therefore, where the
judge is instructed to look to the requirements of good faith, to the
practice of honest men, or, as in the suit of a wife against her
husband, to what is good and equal, the jurist should be ready to
speak. For he is the authority on what constitutes fraud or good
faith, what is good and equal, what are the mutual duties of
partnerS, of principal and agent, whether authorized or unauthorized,
of husband and wife.’

Many questions of law were undoubtedly decided at the initial
stage of an action, in jure, at the appearance before the tribunal or
curule chair of the praetor. At this appearance the partios were
at-tended by counsel (haerere in jure atque praetorum tribunalibus
[advocatos] De Oratore, 1, 38); and here, though the praetor
would not settle a dispute about facte, many demurrers or simple
issues of law or equity might be decided, and the controversy might
be terminatcd without ever reaching the stage of reference to a
judex. The praetor, however, had no leisure to determine compli-
cated issues of law or equity, and these were accordingly referred
to a judex or arbiter by a formula in jus concepta.

ᾧ 46. According to the InstituteS, a man might not summon his
patron or parent to appear in an action without the permission of
the praetor, under a penalty of fifty solidi, Inst. 4, 16, 3. A solidus
or aureus was a hundred sesterces, so that we must either, with
Savigny, for ten thousand read five thousand sesterces in the text
of Gaius, or suppose that J ustinian reduced the penalty to half its
original amount.

In the formulary system an appearance of the defendant before ¹
the praetor (in jure) was indispensable as the first stage of an action. 2²
In English law, after service of summons or proof that all proper
means for the service of summons have been used in vain, the court
will grant lea-ve to the plaintiff to enter an appearance for the·
defendant. But in Roman law an original appearance of the de-
fendant at the commencement of the action was indispensable.
On service of a summons (in jus vocatio) he was bound either tc
obey at· once and accompany the plaintiff into court, or to send a
responsible representative (vindex, ᾧ 46) in his stead, or to find
security‚ called cautio judicio sisti (to be thus interpreted: cautio
sisti in jure ad judicium ordinandum), for his appearance in jure on
