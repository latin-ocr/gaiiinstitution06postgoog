ad quem ancillae ususfructus per-
tinet, partum etiam suum esse cre-
dens vendiderit aut donaverit, fur-
tum non committit3 furtum enim
sine affectu furandi non commit-
titur. aliis quoque modis accidere
potest, ut quis sine vitio furti rem
alienam ad aliquem transferat et
efficiat, ut a possessore usucapiatur.

ξ 51. Fundi quoque alieni potest
aliquis sine vi possessionem nancisci,
quae vel ex negligentia domini vacet,
vel quia domin‘us sine successore
decesserit vel longo tempore afuerit.
nam si ad alium bona fide accipien-
tem transtulerit, poterit usucapere
possessor3 et quamvis ipse qui va-
cantem possessionem nactus est, in-
tellegat alienum esse fundum, tamen
nihil hoc bonae fidei possessori ad
usucapionem nocet, cwm inprobata
sit eorum sententia qui putaverint
furtivum fundum fieri posse.

ξ 52. Rursus ex contrario accidit,
ut qui sciat alienam rem se possi-

dere usucapiat: velut si rem here-

ditariam cuius possessionem heres
nondum nactus est, aliquis posse-
derit3 nam ei concessum est usu·
capere, si modo ea res est quae re-
cipit usucapionem. ’ quae species
possessionis et usucapionis pro
herede vocatur.

553. Et in tantum haec usu-
capio concessa est, ut et res quae
solo continentur anno usucapiantur.

554. Quare autem etiam hoc
casu soli rerum annua constituta
sit usucapio, illa ratio est, quod
olim rerum hereditariamm posses-
sione velut ipsae hereditates usucapi
credebantur, scilicet ann0. lex enim
ΧΠ tabularum soli quidem res bi-
ennio usucapi iussit, ceteras vero
anno. ergo hereditas in ceteris rebus

[11. §§ 40-61.

away, is not guilty of theft: again,
the usufructuary of a female slave
who believes her offspring to be his
property and sells it or gives it
away, is not guilty of theft3 for
theft implies unlawful intention:
and similarly other circumstances
may prevent the crime of theft from
attaching to the delivery of a thing
belonging to another, and enable
the receiver to acquire by usu-
capion.

§ 51. Laud belonging to another
may be entered without violence,
when vacant by neglect of the
owner, or by his death without
leaving a successor, or his long
absence from the country, and an
innocent person to whom the pos-
session is transferred may acquire
the property by usucapion3 for
though the original seizer of the
vacant possession knew that the
land belongs to another, yet his
knowledge is no bar to the usu·
capion of the innocent alienee, as
it is no longer held that theft can
be committed of land.

§ 52. On the other hand, know-
ledge of the existence of a pro⁶
prietor does not always prevent
usucapion‚ for any one may seize
a portion of an inheritance of which
the heir has not yet taken posses-
sion and acquire it by usucapion‚
provided it is susceptible of usu—
capion‚ and he is said to acquire by
title of quasi successor.

ξ 53. With such sacility is this
usucapion permitted that even land
may be thus acquired in a year.

ξ 54. The reason why even land
in these circumstances demands only
a year for usucapion ie, thatin an-
cient times the possession of portions
of the inheritance was held to be a
means of acquiring the inheritance
itself, and that, of course, in a year:
for while the law of the Twelve
Tables fixed two years for the usu·
