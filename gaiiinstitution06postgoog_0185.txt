earth, are by their nature essentially res communes. Being in-
capable of appropriation, they have not been appropriated and are
held in communism. Again, the distinction of res corporales and
res incorporales may ground the distinction between Dominion and
Primordial rights· Again, in wild animals, as opposed to tame,
property is only coextensive with detention. On the difference
between specific and generic things, or things consumed by use,
quae pondere numero mensnrave constant, and things not consumed

by use, is founded the distinction between the contracte of mutuum
and commodatum. On the same differeuce of specific and generic

things are founded in English law different mles for the trans-
mutation of property in the contract of sale, 3 ᾗ 139; and the
distinction of movables and immovables fouuds a still more im-
portant difference in the English forms of alienation and rules of
succession.

The phrases in nostro patrimonio and extra nostrum patrimonium,
ξ 1, are apparently equivalent to alicujus in bonis and nullius in
bonis, 49, and to the expressions we meet elsewhere, in commercio
and extra commercium.

Of res communes, or the dominion of mankind, which sometimes
comes under discussion but is not mentioned by Gaius, we may
observe, that it scarcely falls within the scope of our present pro-
vince, namely, positive law, for all positive law is confined to
the territory of the particular sovereign state by which it is ’
enacted.

All the things within-the territory of a given state are subject to
its dominion, that is, are res publicae in a general sense of the term.
Of these things it allows the dominion over some to vest in private
individuals for their own advantage, while it retains the dominion
over others in itself as a corporation or collective person (per-
sonarum universitas). This gives us a division of all things into
res privatae and res publicae ln a narrower sense of the term. We
must note, however, that the dominion of the state is not exactly
similar to private dominion, that is to say, is not dominion in
the proper sense or the sense in which the word is used' 111 civil
law. For the civil dominion of private persons is a right pro-
tectcd and sanctioned by a political superior, whereas a sovereign
state is by hypothesis in subjection to no superior. A state, then,
can only be said to have dominion in a modificd sense of the word,
that is, so far as it is not restrained by any positive law of any
