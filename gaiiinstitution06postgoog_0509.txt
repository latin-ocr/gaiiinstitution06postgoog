ιν. §§ 1—9.] Ac‘noNtm Dmsm. 48⁷

a rural servitude, contained an intentio to this effect: Si paret jus
eundi per illum fundum ex jure Quiritium Aulo Agerio competere.

A Personal action, on the contrary, named in the intentio the
defendant, who was alleged to be under an obligation to the
plaintiff. E. g. if the plaintiff alleged that the defendant lay under
an obligation to pay him a certain sum of money, the intentio
was in this form: Si paret Aulo Agerio Numerium Negidium
(defendant) sestertium decem millia dare oportere.

The word Dare is used in the Intentio of a Condictio Certi, i. e.
an action wherein the plaintiff asserts that the defendant is under
an obligation to convey quiritary property in a determinate thing,
whether a sum of money or any other subject of property, a certain
slave, certain corn, certain land. E. g. Si paret Numerium Negi-
dium Aulo Agerio sestertium decem millia—tritici Africi optimi
centum modios—iter per illum fundum ad illum fundum—dare
oportere. ,

’Πι6 word Facere never appears to stand alone in an intentio, but
in its stead we have Dare facere in the Intentio of Condictio Incerti,
that is, of an action to enforce a claim of an uncertain amount, a
claim of any service but the transfer of quiritary property in a
certain thing, that is, to enforce any obligation (except those ex-
pressed by Praestare) not included under Dare as above defined.
E. g. Quidquid paret Numerium Negidium Aulo Agerio dare facere
oportere.

Praestare does not appear to have ever been used in the Intentio
of a Formula. Praestare is a term of wider meaning than the two
preceding, and appears specifically to denote reparation for any
harm, compensation for any lose, the fulfilment, that is, of a delictual
obligation. It is also used in connection with the obligation ex
fide bona arising out of culpa and dolus relat-ing to Contract. In
all civil actions founded on Delict the intentio was probably in
the terms: damnum decidere oportere, ξ 37. All non-civil or prae-
torian actions had an intentio in factum concepta.

§3. Negativa. An action respecting a servitude was either
confessoris or Negativa. If the plaintiff claimed a servitude over
the land or house of the defendant, his action was called Con·
sessoria3 if he denied that his own land or house was subject to
a servitude, his action was called Negativa (or Negatoria) in rem
actio. In Confessoria the intentio was of the form: jus mihi csse,
invito te, utendi fruendi: in Negatoria of the form 3 jus tibi non esse,
