136 DE PERSONIS.

ξ 180. Item si qua in tutela legi-
tima furiosi aut muti sit, permitti-
tur ei senatusconsulto dotis consti-
tuendae gratia tutorem petere.

§ 181. Quibus casibus salvam
manere tutelam patrono patronique
filio manifestum est.

ξ 182. Praeterea senatus censuit,
ut si tutor pupilli pupillaeve suspec-
tus a tutela remotus sit, sive ex
iusta causa fuerit excusatus, in
locum eius alius tutor detur, quo
dato prior tutor amittit tutelam.

ξ 183. Haec ommia similiter et
Romae et in provinciis solent obser-
van....s1ver0....

ξ 184. Olim cum legis actiones
in usu erant, etiam ex illa causa
tutor dabatur. si inter tutorem et
mulierem pupillumve legis actione
agendum erat: mm quia ipse qui-
dem tutor in re sua auctor esse non
poterat, alius dabatur, quo auctore
illa leqia actio perageretur .· qui
dicebatur praetorius tutor, quia a
praetore urbano dabatur. post sub-
latas legis actiones quidam putant
hanc speciem dandi tutoris non ease
necessariam ,· sed adhuc dari in
usu esc, si legitimo iudicio aqatur.

[1. §§ 173-184.

§ 180. Also, a woman whose
statutory guardian is a lunatic or
dumb is permitted by the senatus-
consult, for the purpose of settling
her dower, to apply for a substitu-
tive guardian.

ξ 181. In which cases the con-
tinued guardianship of the patron
or patron's son is undisputed.

ξ 182. The senate further decreed
that if the guardian of a male or
female ward is suspected of mis·
conduct and removed from office, or
if he alleges valid grounds for de-
clining to act and is relieved of his
functione, a substitute shall be ap·
pointed by the magistrate, and on
his appointment the office os the
former guardian shall determine.

ξ 183. These rules are in force
both in Rome and in the provinces·

ξ 184. During the era of litiga-
tion by statute-process [4 ξ 10],
another cause of appointing a sub·
stitute was the imminence of statute-
process between the guardian and
the woman or ward3 for as the
guardian could not give his autho-
rity in respect of his own suit,
another guardian was appointed to
authorize the proceedings iu the
action, who was called a praetorian
guardian, because he was appointed
by the praetor of the city. Since
the abolition of statute-process
some hold this kind of guardian to
be unnecessary, but the appointment

is still customary on the occasion cf

a statutory suit. (4 ξ 103.)

ᾗ 179. The law was changed by J ustinian, who enacted that no
one could become guardian who had not attained his majority,
i.e. eompleted twenty-five years of age, Cod. 5, 30, 5.

ᾗ 183. The ambiguity of the Latin lang-uage leaves it doubtful
whether in the foregoing paragraphs‚ ᾗῇ 173, 176, 180, 182, Gaius
refers to one or several senatusconsults. From D. 26, 1, 17, how-
ever, it appears that, complura senatusconsulta facta sunt ut in
locum furiosi et muti et surdi tutoris alii tutores dentur: i.e. the
