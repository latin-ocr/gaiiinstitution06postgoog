ascensam of rights and obligations (umvsnsrras sums), such
as Hereditas A UNIVERSITAS smus includes obligations as well
as Rights, J us in personam as well as J us in rem, and Sanction-
ing rights as well as Sanctioned rights. But in spite of the
diverse character of these elements of which it is composed, the
sums UNIVERSITAS itself, or the ideal whole of these various
elementS, is regarded, e. g. in Hereditatis petitio, as a Right, not
an Obligation3 as a J us in rem, not a J us in personam 3 as a
Sanctioned right, not a Sanctioning right. (As Res includes
Obligation (res incorporalis) as well as Dominion (res corporalis),
Ι have used the term RERUM umvmrsrms to denominate the sub-
ject of Books H and III, as marking more clearly than smus
UNIVERSITAS an antithesis to RES sumnum though I am aware
that Rerum universitas has generally a more i nsignificant accepta-
tion, denoting an artificia] whole—a fiock, herd, or library—in
opposition to the ingredients—the single sheep, homes, books—of
which it is composed.)

As Gaius thought that he could obtain the idea of Dominion 'by
a division of Res into corporalis and incorporalis, so he seems to
have thought that he could distinguish private dominion, the special
department which he intends to examine, from other forms of domi-
nion by a further division of Res. The phrases res divinae, res
humanae, res communes, res publicae, res privatae, do, indeed, sug-
gest the notion that res privatae is a specific member of the genus
Res3 but the appearance is fallacious. Very little ressection will
convince us that res divinae, res publicae, res privatae are not
a division of the sUBJEcrs of property (res); for the same thing, a
piece of ground, for instance, may be the subject of divine or public
or private dominion 3 but merely a division of proprietorS. In res
divinae, the only doubtful case, the gods were deemed to be pro-
prietors. Sed et illa interdicta quae de locis sacris et de religiosis
proponuntur veluti proprietatis causam continent, Dig. 43, 1, 2, 2.
‘ The interdicte respecting sacred and religious places protect a
quasi-property?

The division of the subjects of right by their physical differences,
the only way in which they can be divide-d, though only of subor-
dinate importance, and though it cannot furnish the distinctions of
Dominion and Obligation, nor of Public and Private dominion, yet
has a considerable influence on jurisprudence, and demands a certain
amount of attention. Thus ocean, air, and light, as opposed to the
