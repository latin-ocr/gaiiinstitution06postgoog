Ulpian, that bears on the matter in question. Paragraphs 3 ᾧ 24,

An apograph or faesimile edition of the Veronese MS. has been
published in the last year by Studemund, and we may hope that the
learned editor will shortly pnblish a version of the text containing
the emendations suggested by the apograph. In the meantime I
have reprinted the very judicious edition of Gaius given by Gneist
in his syntagma Iuris Romani, with, however, a few variatione,
which are indicated in an Appendix.

In the text of Gaius, the words or portions of words which are
purely conjectural are denoted by italice. The orthography of the
Veronese MS. is extremely inconstant. Some of these inconstancies
it will be seen are retained: e. g. the spelling oscillates between the
forms praegnas and praegnans, nanctus and nactus, erciscere and
herciscere, prendere and prehendere, diminuere and deminuere,
parentum and parentium, vulgo and volgo, apud and aput, sed and
set, proxumus and proximus, affectus and adfectus, inponere and
imponere, 810. Some irregularities likely to embarrass the reader‚
e.g. the substitution of v for b in debitor and probare, the substi-
tution of b for v in servus and vitium, have been tacitly corrected.
The numeration of the paragraphs was introduced by Goeschen in
his first edition of Gaius, and for convenience of reference has been
retained by all subsequent editors. The rubrics or titles marking
the larger divisione of the subject, with the exception of a few at
the beginning, are not found in the Veronese MS. These that are
found are not very apposite, and are supposed not to be the work
of Gaius, but of a transcriber. To distinguish them from the others
they are accompanied with a translation. 'Phe remainder are partly
taken from the corresponding sections of J ustinian's Institutes,
- partly invented or adopted from other editors,

An elementary treatise can scarcely make any profession of
originality. I have availe‘d myself of lights wherever 1 could
obtain them. And, not to crowd the following pages with references
to the writers to whOm I am indebted, I must here once for all
acknowledge my obligation, not to mention many authors from
whom I have borrowed isolated views or quotations, to Austin,
to Ortolan, to Puchta‚ to Ihering‚ to Bethmann-Hollweg, and above
all to Vangerow and Von Savigny.

For the sake of studente who have used the first edition it may
