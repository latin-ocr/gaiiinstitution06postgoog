ξ 82. If there is a genuine antithesis between suo nomine and
alieno nomine, the procuratorium, tutorium‚ &c.‚ nomen, which is
the alienum nomen with which the procurator or guardian sues, must
mean the name, not of the procurator or guardian, but of the principal
or ward. When a man sues suo nomine he uses his own name in
the intentio, therefore when a man sues procuratorio nomine he uses
the procuratorium nomen in the intentio. But the name inserted
in the intentio by a procurator is not the name of the procurator,
but that of the principal.

Eam popularem actionem dicimus quae suum jus-populo tuetur,
Dig. 47, 23, 1. ‘ A public action is one which defends the interest
of the people.' A popularis actio was one brought by a common
informer to recover a penalty. The informer enforced, not a
private but a public right, that is, sued as the procurator of the
peop1e; and therefore an infamis, as he was disabled from being
procurator, was incompetent to prosecute in such an action. 'I'o
public actions and actions by an assertor libertatis J ustinian adds,
as maintainable by a representative under the old jurisprudence,
actions in behalf of a ward. We have already mentioned, page 119,
that until the ward attained the age of seven the guardian acted in
the name of the ward3 after the age of seven the ward acted with
· the authority of the guardian.

ξ 84. A person who without instructions (mandatum) officiously
interposed and undertook the defence of an absent neighbour was
called negotiorum gestor, or defensor, or procurator voluntarius.
The employment of a cognitor, from the necessity of appointing
him in the presence of the adversary and by a certain formula, was
discontinued as inconvenient, and J ustinian only speaks of the
procurator. ’
