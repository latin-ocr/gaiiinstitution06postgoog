and the method substantially followed by Gaius, we may adopt the
following division ε·-

Equal rights are either smonomrn, primary‚ fina13 or
SANG'HONING, secondary, instrumental-

Smenomn rights are either—
Rm : rights availing against all the world (ms m m), or

PansoML: rights availing against certain determinate persons
(sus m passorum).

Sanctioned rights against the world are either—-
Unrelated to the external material universe, or
Related to the material universe.

Sanctioned rights unrelated to the material universe are
rmnonnuu„ or inborn rights. (These are not examined
separately by GaiuS, but are implied in obligatio ΒΧ
ΒΒιῙοτο.)

Sanctioned rights related to the material universe are Pos-
snssmn, DommoN, smvlrunn.

Sanctioned rights availing exclusively against certain persons,
cori-elate to obligations ΒΧ ooonrU: that is, to the
duties immediately produced by contract and before its
violation.

Smenoumc rights are capable of the same subdivision as
εΛΝσΠοΝΒΒ rights. They are not examined separately by
Gaius, but partly under the head of obligatio ΒΧ ΒΒΒΙοΤο
(founded on violation of anossmAL or other ΒΒΔΙ, right),
partly under the head of obligatio ΒΧ conmori] (obligation
produced indirectly by contract, that is, by its violation), partly
under the head of ΑσΠοΝΒε (procedure) ε personal actions prose-
cuting obligation ΒΧ nnuc'ro and ΒΧ οοΝΤΒΛσΓυ; and real
actions being the remedy for violations of Possnssmn, noummu,
smzvl'runn.

We shall find hereafter that the position of POSSESSION, in
Roman jurisprudence—whether it belongs to the department of
ms m mm or of OBLIGA‘HO ΒΧ onmem is a moot question3 but
at present we need do no more than notice the existence of the
controversy. We need also only to indicate a further division
of rights and obligations into smum rights and obligations,
such as those of which we have just given a classification, and
