The former class were not an extension of the law, but only pre-
served to a plaintiff the remedies which he otherwise would have
lost by the change of procedure when statute-process was abolished. .
For instance, the fiction of Pignoris capio was employed to 't
preserve unimpaired the rights of the revenue contractor and as 1¹
a measure for assessing the damages to which he was entitled
against a defaulter.

'Phe second class of fictions was an extension or reform of the
law, protecting persons whose rights had previously not been
recognized, or mitigating the rigours and liberalizing the narrow-
mindedness of the ancient barbarous legislation: granting to the
bonitarian proprietor by inberitance or purchase the protection
enjoyed by the quiritarian proprietor; giving to the alien the
redress provided for the citizen, and preserving to the creditor
the remedies extinguished by the debtor’s diminution of status,
In their task of ameliorating the law the praetors proceeded as un-
obtrusively as possible, by tacit rather than by open legislation, and
rather by innovations in the adjective code, to use Bentham's
expression, or code of procedure, than in the substantive code.
The introduction of the formulary system, giving them authority
to create new actions, had virtually invested them with much
legislative power. 'Phe new actions introduced by the praetor were
called actiones utiles. Utiles actiones were either fictitiae or in
factum. Let us examine the mode of their operation. The logie
of justice as administered in the courts may be regarded as a syl-
logism, of which the major premiss is the substantive law annexing
a certain remedy to¹ certain conditions (to a certain title) 3 the minor
premiss the proposition that between the present plaintiff and de-
fendant these conditions are satisfied ; and the conclusion, the
enforcement of the remedy in favour of the plaintiff by the executive.
Let A represent the remedy or sanctioning right, B the conditions
or title, C the plaintiff or his facts, (If C represents the defendant,
A will represent the sanctioning duties or obligations). 'Phe praetor
proceeded in two ways, (1) Without or (2) with the use of fiction.

(1) Without expressly asserting the major premiss, B is A, or avow-
edly introducing a new principle of substantive law, it is clear that
he introduced it by implication if he made the conclusion, C is A,
follow from the minor premiss, C is B. He did so in granting an actio
in factum, one of his most potent instrumenta, that is, an actio whose
intentio in factum concepta, of the form, Si paret . . . . fecisse, proposed
