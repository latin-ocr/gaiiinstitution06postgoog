(whether made a slave by the de-
livery, or reduced to the condition
of an insolvent judgment debtor,
was an old question) ; a slave was
first scourged and then flung from
the Tarpeiam rock. Later ages dis-
approved of the severity of this
punishment, and theft, whether by
a slave or by a froeman, was pun-
ished by the praetorian edict with
fourfold damages.

ξ 190. Simple theft is punished
ΒΥ the law of the Twelve Tables
with double damages, which penalty
the praetor has retained.

Tables with triple damages, a pen·
alty which the praetor has also
adopted.

ξ 192. Prevention of search ren-
ders liable to fourfold damages, a
penalty which the edict of the prae-
tor first ordained. The Twelve
Tables inflicted no penalty for such
an offence, but directed that the
subsequent searcher must be naked,
only wearing a girdle, and carrying
a platter in his hands, and made
the ensuing discovery of stolen
goods· a detection of theft in the
commission.

ξ 193. What the girdle was, is
doubted, but it seems to have been
a covering for the loins. The whole
enactment of the Twelve Tables ιε
nugatory‚ for he that preventa a
man from searching in his clothes
would prevent him from searching
naked, especially as in such a
search the finding of stolen goods
would subject him to a heavier
penalty. Besides, whether the plat-
ter is to be held ΒΥ the searcher in
order that his hands being engaged
in holding it may not bring any·
thing into the house, or in order
that what is found may be placed
