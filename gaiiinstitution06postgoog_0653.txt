slaves or procurator, as he alleges, which he possessed without
violence, clandestinity, or permission in respect of thee, in that
place do thou reinstate him!

'l'he intel-dict De vi armata may be restored as follows: Unde tu
Numeri Negidi aut familia aut procurator tuus Aulum Agerium aut
familiam aut procuratorem illius vi hominibus coactis armatisve
dejecisti, qua de re agitur, eo restituas. ‘ In the place whence thou,
Numerius Negidius, thy slaves or procurator, hast violently custod
Aulus Agerius, his slaves or procurator, by men assembled or armed,
in that place do thou reinstate him.’ This differed from the ordinary
interdict by the omission of the exceptions‚ and the omission of
limitation to a year.

'I'he interdict Unde vi only applied to immovables. Illud utique
in dubium non venit, interdictum hoc ad res mobiles non pertinere,
Dig. 43, 16, 6. ‘ It is certain that this interdict is not available for
disseisin of movables?

The right of the defendant in the ordinary interdict to plead by
way of exception the vices (violence, seerecy, permission) by which
the plaintiff ’s possession was tain‘oed, was apparently deemed to be
abrogated by a constitution of Valentinian,⁴ Aa). 389. Si quis in
tantam furoris pervenerit audaciam, ut possessionem rerum apud
fiscum vel apud homines quoslibet constitutarum ante adventum
judicialis arbitrii violenter invaserit, dominus quidem constitutus
possessionem quam abstulit restituat possessori, et dominium
ejusdem rei amittat. Si vero alienarum rerum possessionem invasit,
non solum eam possidentibus reddat, verum etiam aestimationem
earum rerum restituere compellatur, Cod. 8, 4, 7. ‘ Whoever dares
to seize by violence things in the pooeession of the treasury or of
private persons without waiting for a judicia] order, shall restore
possession, aud, if he is proprietor, shall forfeit his property, if he
is not proprietor, shall forfeit the value.' This was declared to
apply both to movables and immovables, Inst. 4, 2, 1. In ac-
cordance with the spirit of this constitution, the dispossessor was
no longer allowed to plead the exceptione in the old form of the
interdict, and they are omitted in the new form which we find in
the Digest: Unde tu illum vi dejecisti aut familia tua dejecit, de eo
quaeque ille tunc ibi habuit tantummodo intra annum, post annum
de eo quod ad enm quivi dejecit pervenerit, judicium debe, Dig.
43, 16, 1. ‘ The land (or, house) whence thou or thy slaves hast
violently ousted such a one, and the movables which he had
