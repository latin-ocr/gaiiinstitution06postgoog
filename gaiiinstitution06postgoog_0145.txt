extinguish gentile title by cognation as well as civil title by agna-
tion, Inst. 1, 16, 6.

The truth is, that the effects of a collision of Civil and Natural
law fall under two very different classes, which it is important to
distinguish.

1. If the command of the civil lawgiver, under the sway of
motives financial, political, ethical‚ or religious, is highly imperious
and absolutely compulsive‚ all natural titles with which it may
come in conflict are absolutely void and inoperative: e. g. the Sc. 1
Velleianum‚ prohibiting suretyship of women, allowed no naturalis
obligatio to be produced by any such suretyship: and so with the
laws prohibiting gambling and usury.

2. If the command of the civil law is less peremptory and abso-
lute, it may deprive any conflicting natural title of plenary force,
and yet leave to it a naturalis obligatio capable of acquiring efficacy
by some machinery of Positive law3 e, g. the Sc. Macedonianum,
prohibiting money loans to a filiusfamilias without the sanction ·of
his father, made them irrecoverable by action, and yet the courts
recognized in the borrowing filiusfamilias a naturalis obligatio, x
which was capable of novation‚ Dig. 46, 2, 19, and a bar to ,
recovery back (condictio indebiti) in case of actual repayment‚ Dig. ¹
14, 6, 10.

When J ustinian revolutionized the law of intestate succession
and made the right of succession depend on cognation instead of
agnation‚ he made a corresponding change in the obligation of
guardianship‚ which henceforth devolved on cog-nates instead of
agnates‚ women as formerly, with the exception of mothers and
grandmothers, being excluded from the office, NoV. 118, 5.
