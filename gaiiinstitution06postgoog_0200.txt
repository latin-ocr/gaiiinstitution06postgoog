process which seigned that there was no transfer. Manus and
mancipium could be extinguished but not transferred [Ihering,

‘G' ' §BQ except that, apparently, mancipium could be retransferred to

the natural parent or mancipator, 1 ξ 132.

The statement of Gaius that the attempt to eede a usufruct
to a stranger is inoperative, a statement adopted by J ustinian ‚
Inst. 2, 4, 3, appears inconsistent with the doctrine of Pomponius,
a contemporary of Gaius: diximus usumfructum a fructuario cedi
non poaee nisi domino proprietatiS, et, si extraneo cedatur, id est
ei qui proprietatem non habeat, nihil ad eum transire, sed ad
dominum proprietatis reversurum usumfructum, D. 23, 3, 66 ε’ i. e.
the attempt to cede a usufruct to a stranger produces a consolida-
tion, that is to say, its extinction by merger in the property of
the reversioner. Vangerow, ᾗ 344, holds that this passage of
Pomponius, being inconsistent with the doctrine that finally pre-
vailed, was admitted into the Digest by inadvertence.

'Phe statement that usufruct, like all other personal servitudes,
was inalienable, must, however, be taken with this reservation:
although the right itself was intransferable, yet the exercise or
” enjoyment of the right might be transferred by lease, sale, or dona-
tion, D. 7, 1, 38: it. while the jus utendi fruendi in the eye of
the law still vested in the usufructuary, the actual use and fruition
might be enjoyed by a lessee, vendes, or donee.

ᾤ 31. It appears that convention (pactio) alone unaecompanied
by tradition or quasi tradition was capable of creating a servitude,
in opposition to the general rule of Roman laW, that convention
ean only create at the utmost an obligation (jus m personam), and
in order to create a jus in rem must be accompanied by delivery
of possession. Other exceptional instances in which convention
without any further accompaniment creates a jus in rem, that is,
transfers either property or jus in re, are hypotheca (see 3 §91)
and societas omnium bonorum (see 3 ξ 148). Vangerow, however,
holds, ᾧ 350, that pactio and stipulatio could not create a. genuine
servitus, enforcible against the serviens and his assigns (singular
successore), but only an obligatio, enforcible against the serviens
and his heirs (universal successors): that in the time of Gaius this
was all that could be accomplished3 but that afterwards, when
quasi traditio of res incorporalis was recognized as practicable,
genuine Servitudes could be constituted by Quasi-tradition.
