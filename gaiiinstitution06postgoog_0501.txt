111. §§ 220-225.] DILIGENCE, NEGLIGENCE. 4⁷9

praestant hi quibus res commodata est, ut diligentiam praestet
exactiorem quam in suis rebus adhiberet, Dig. 18, 6, 3), the con-
ductor, (Culpa autem abest si omnia facta sunt quae diligentissimus
quisque observaturus fuisset, Dig. 19, 2, 257), the locator, (In
judicio tam locati quam conducti dolum et custodiam, uon etiam
casum cui resisti non potest, venire constat, Cod. 4, 6, 28). The
principle appears to be that when a eontract is for the interest
of both parties, although their interests are rather adverse than
identical, each is responsible for the least negligence. (In con-
tractibus bonae fidei servatur, ut, si quidem utriusque contrahentis
commodum versetur, etiam culpa, sin unius solius, dolus malus‘
tantummodo praestetur, Dig. 30, 108, 12). This principle will
require the same amount of diligenee from the mortgagor and
vendee.

Finally, extraordinary care is required of the agent, (A pro-
curatore dolum et omnem culpam, non etiam improvisum casum,
praestandum esse, juris auctoritate manifeste declaratur, cod. 4,
35, 13. Aliena vero negotia exacto officio geruntur, nee quid-
quam in eorum administratione neglectum ae declinatum culpa
vacuum est, cod. 4, 35, 21), whether authorized or unauthorized,
(Quo casu ad exactissimam quisque diligentiam compellitur reddere
rationem, nec sufficit talem diligentiam adhibere qualem suis rebus
adhibere soleret, si modo alius diligentior commodius administra-
turus esset negotia, Inst. 3, 27, 1).

It is not easy to say why more dilig-enee is required of the
authorized agent than of the depositary, as both are unremunerated.
Perhaps it is because in agency the direct and express purpose
and intent of the contract is that an experieuced agent should
devote more skill and vigilance to the interests of the prineipal
than the principal himself is able to bestow; whereas in other
contracte diligeuee is merely an implied and aceessory or in-
cidental obligation.

Moreover, Ageney was not really gratuitous: the honorarium
of the Agent, as we have seen, though not recoverable in an
ordinary action before a judex, being recoverable at the tribunal
of the praetor in the exereise of his cognitio extraordinaria.

The amount of diligenee a man habitually shows in his own
affairs is all that is required of the following persons: the de-
positary, (Quod Nerva diceret latiorem culpam dolum esse, Pro-
culo displicebat, mihi verissimum videtur. Nam etsi quis non
