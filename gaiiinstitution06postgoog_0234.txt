ξ 87. Manus and mancipium had ceased to exist before the time
of Justinian, and patria potestas was much reduced. Originally,
the filiusfamilias was incapable of property: in the peculium, the
goods he was allowed to administer, he had no property nor even
possession, 4· ξ 148, but merely detention. The military profession
were the first to emerge from this position of inferiority, and in
respect of peculium castrense the filiusfamilias was decmed to have
the status of paterfamilias. By the introduction of peculium quasi
castrense this privilege was extended to certain civil functionaries
and liberal professions: and by inventing peculium adventitium
J ustinian still further emancipated the filiusfamilias, Peculium
adventitium, as opposed to peculium profectitium, was what came
to the son from any other source than the estate and permission of
the father: in respect of peculium profectitium the old law con-
tinued in force ; the paterfamilias remained absolute proprietorj but
in respect of peculium adventitium the right of the father was
reduced to a life estate or usufruct: in respect of the fee or re-
version in remainder after this life estate the filiusfamilias was
proprietor, Inst. 2, 9, 1. The reduction of patria potestaS, and the
abolitiou of the dependent law of Agnatiou‚ may be almost regarded
(so fundamental were these institutione in jus civile) as the abroga-
tion of the civil law, and the substitution in its stead of what the
Romans called jus gentium or the law of nature.

instrument of acquiring possession is decided in the· affirmative,
