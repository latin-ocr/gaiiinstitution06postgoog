446 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [111. §§ 168-181.

, cedure which by provision of the lex Aebutia, whercby statute-

process was abolished, were declared to have the same effect, in
respect of novation and otherwise, as the statute-process, which
they superseded. Actions terminable with the praetorship were such
actions as did not derive their validity from the lex Aebutia, but
from the administrative power of the praetor.

'Phe transformations of Litis contestatio which are described
above were not the last that it was destined to undergo. In the
first stage of procedure under the Canon law, after the libellus of the
plaintiff had been read aloud, the judge asked the plaintiff whether
he abided by his suit3 and, on his answer in the affirmative, his
libellus was contradicted by the defendant in general terms (nego
narrata prout narrantur et dico petita fieri non debere). The
detailed contention of the parties over the particular averments of
the plaintiff did not follow till a subsequent stage.

In Ger-many in ΑΛ). 1654 an ordinance of the empire required
the defendant to answer all 13116 allegatione · of the plaintiff and
adduce all his own exceptione at the first stage: and, as in practice
the reading of the plaintiff’s libellus was omitted, the Litis con-
testati0, or first term or stage of the suit, consisted in this detailed
answer of the defendant. Subsequently, when written documenta
“ superseded oral procedure, the Litis contestatio was identified with
the defendant’ s delivery of what was called 1116 book of exceptione.

The Novation produced by Litis contestatio is called hy modern
writers Novatio necessaria. It has not all the incidente of Novatio
voluntaria, 01· Novation induced by convention: for instance, as
Litis contestatio must not deterior-ate the position of the creditor,
the object of its incidente being to remove the disadvantages which
he suffers from the duration of the suit, it does not extinguish the
accessaries of the principal obligation, e. g. privilegia of widow or
infant, &c., interest, hypotheca, p. 352, Dig. 46, 2, 29. 113 originally,
as we have seen, in consequence of the Correality of the Fidejussor,
1.6. the unity of his obligation with that of the principal, extin-
guished the liability of the Fidejussor: but this rule, as we have
mentioned, was abrogated by J ustinian, who enacted that the
liability of the Fidejussor could not be extinguished by Litis con-
testatiO, but only by Solutio.

Nor, secondly‚ did Novatio necessaria, though it extinguished
Civilis obligatio, prevent, like Novatio voluntaria, the continuance
of Naturalis obligatio, Dig. 12, 6, 60.
