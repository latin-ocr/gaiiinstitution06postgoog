4 · PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS.

those which do not involve a private person invested with a cor-
relative right. For instance, the duties violated ΒΥ smuggling,
by polygamy, by breach of prison, by cruelty to brute animals, are
not obligations to a pn'vate person but to the Sovereign, and the
rights of the Sovereign, if he has any, have no limits but the limits
of his might, and bear no resemblance to the rights contemplated
by the Civil code, which are acts or forbearances, enforcible by
appeal to a common human superior 3 for the Sovereign, ex vi ter-
mini, has no human superior. All rightS, then, imply correlative
obligations, but not all obligations imply correlative rights.

Every legislation or system of laws is composed of a vast number
of particular laws‚ having the same or analogous features, just as
every tissue is composed of an infinity of threads, and every vege-
tabIe or animal organism of an infinity of cells: and having before
our eyes the cardinal points of any individual law, by considering
the division or differentiation of these cardinal points we may
anticipate the leading divisions of the general mass of legislation.

Having given the definitions of these cardinal pointS, we will
now notice some of their fundamental divisions.

The primary division of Rights, the one most necessary for
forming clear conceptione on the subject, a division which, as far
as my acquaintance with juristic literature extends, Austin was the
first to make clear and luminous, is the division into Sanctioned
rights and Sanctioning rights. This division of rights depends on
a corresponding division of the Titles to which they are annexed.

Sanctioned, or primary, or final rights, are such rights as exist
antecedently to any Wrong, rights whose 'rifle or origin from
which they spring, and which defines the person on whom they are
conferred, is some circumstance other than a Wrong. Sanctioning,
secondary, or instrumental rights, are rights engendered ΒΥ a Wrong
committed by some other person, rights conferred upon a person
whose title to them is the fact that he has suffered a Wrong.

Wrong is the violation of right or duty, and may be defined as
disobedience, intentional or negligent, to the command of the
sovereign, entitling the wrongdoer to the Sanction, that is, to the
evil threatened ΒΥ the lawgiver. Examples of Sanctioned rights
are the right of a proprietor to enjoy the fruits of ownership, the
right of a contractor to the performance of the promise made by
the person with whom he eontraeted, the right of every respectable
member of society to have his honour unstained, his character
