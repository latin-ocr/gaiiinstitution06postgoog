lv. §§ 138-170.] F ORMULA ARBITRARIA, SPONSIO. 637

(3) is a genuine actio ex delicto. So it was nominally in case (1) ;
but we shall see that hers the delict might be merely fictitious (vis
ex conventu).

Savigny holds that No. (3) was the original application of Uti
possidetis ; and that Nos. (1) and (2) were subsequens· extensione of
its employment and due to jurisprudence, i. e. the ingenuity of the
jurists: the reverse is the prevalent doctrine, Baton, ᾧ 120.

ᾗ 163. The formula arbitraria in Unde vi must have contained
the clause, Unless the defendant obey the j udge’s order of resti-
tution3 the rest is uncertain. The analogy of the other interdicte
suggests something to the following effect: If it appear that the
defendant has disobeyed the praetor's order to reinstate the plain-
tiff, then, unless the defendant comply with the judge's order of
restitution, do thou, judge, condemn him in all the damages the
plaintiff shall have sustained.

The mode of restitution would be prescribed ΒΥ the judex, who
would probably require the restitution of all movables that had
been removed, though these were not mentioned in the original
form of the interdict‚ ᾧ 154.

The jurists who considered that a defendant who desired a
formula arbitraria was guilty ΒΥ confession of the delict laid to his
charge, must have supposed that the only function of the judex in this
case was assessment of damages (litis aestimatio), Dig. 9, 2, 25, 2.

ᾧ 165. Huschke supposes that the sponsio on Quorum bonorum.-
was of the following form: If the praetor Quintus Caepio in ac-
cordance with his edict has granted me possession of the goods lest
ΒΥ Tur-pilia, and if in contravention of his edict thou hast not
restored to me the portion of those goods which thou possessest as
successor or as occupant, or hast fraudulently ceased to possess3
dost thou promise to pay me such and such a sum ⁴? I promise.

The stricti juris action based on this stipulatio would be followed
ΒΥ another, which was doubtless called judicium Secutorium, ᾧ 166.
The latter would probably contain an intentio in factum concepta,
of the form: Si Aulus Agerius Numerium Negidium sponsione
vicit, and a formula arbitraria such as that already described for
the non-penal procedure: Ni Numerius Negidius Aulo Agerio
bona illa judicis arbitrio restituat, quanti ea res erit, judex, Nume-
rium Negidium Aulo Agerio condemna.

After the first appearance before the praetor (in jus vocatio) and
the issue of the interdict (interdictum redditum or editum) it would
