gation. What actions are statutory,
and what determine with (or, derive
their force from) the praetorship,

ᾧ 168. Gaius only considers at present the modes of extinguishing
311 obligation, i. e. the modes whereby an obligation ceases to exist.
In the next book, 4 ᾧ 115, 116 will treat of the exceptio, that is to
say, a defence to an action, whereby, though the right of the plaintiff
continues to exist, it is deprived of its operation by being con-
fronted with 311 adverse right of the defendant3 which defence

required to be alleged with the permission of the praetor in a ›. · ι

special clause of the formula. called the exceptio,

Every obligation, as we have seen, 3 ᾧ 88, commentary, relates to
a certain datio, facti0, or praestati03 that is to say, the sulfilment
01· satisfaction (solutio) of every obligation will consist in datio,
factiO, or praestatiO.

The doctrine of Sabinus, that accord and satisfaction (in solutum
datio) operate the extinction of an obligation, was the view that
ultimately prevailed. Manifesti juris est, tam alio pro debitore
solvente, quam rebus pro numerata pecunia consentiente creditore
datis tolli paratam obligationem, Cod. 8, 43, 17. ‘ It is certain
that payment by a third person, and the conveyance of goods
instead of money, with the consent of the creditor, discharges an
obligation.’

ᾧ 170. Aquilius GalluS, the colleague of Cicero in his praetorshi p,
the pupil of Quintus Mucius and teacher of Servius Sulpiciae, was
the inventor of formulas relating to dolus malus, Cic. de Off. 3, 14,
and 3 mode of releasing from 311 obligations by 3 verbal ceremony.
Est prodita stipulatio quae vulgo Aquiliana appellatur, per quam
stipulationem contingit ut omnium rerum obligatio in stipulatum
deducatur et ea per acceptilationem tollatur. Stipulatio enim
Aquiliana novat omnes obligationes et 3 Gallo Aquilio ita com-
posita est: Quicquid te mihi ex quacunque 631163 dare facere
oportet, oportebit, praesens in diemve aut sub condicione; quarum-
cumque rerum mihi tecum acti0, quaeque abs te petitio vel ad-
versus te persecutio est, erit, quodve tu meum habe'S, tenes, possides,
possedisti, dolove malo fecisti quominus possideas: quanti quaeque
earum rerum res-erit, tantam pecuniam dari stipulatus est Aulus
