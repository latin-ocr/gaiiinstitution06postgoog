by the death or absence, malicious (dolo malo) or involuntary, of
the heres or fiduciarius. No remedy was provided for this con-
tingency till the time of J ustinian, who enacted that in such a
case the inheritance should vest in the fideicommissarius by mere
operation of law (ipso jure) by means of a fiction of aditio and
restitutio, a fiction introduced, as evidenced by the term actio
utilis, into the remedy of the cestui que trust. Sancimus itaque
ut sive per contumaciam abfuerit is cui restitutio imposita est,
sive morte praeventus nullo relicto successore fuerit, sive a primo
fideicommissario in secundum translatio celebrari jussa est, ipso
jure utiles actiones transferantur, Cod. 6, 49, 7. ‘ Be it enacted, that
on the contumacious absence or death unsuccesded of a fiduciarius
or of a first fideicommissarius charged in favour of a second, the
law itself operate a transfer of fictitious actions from such persons
to the cestui que trust.'

quasi partiar-y legates introduced by the Sc. Pegasianum were not
. only a cumbrous machinery, but after all affor-ded an insufficient
security to the parties. The heir and transferres were always in
mutual danger of one another's insolvency, and an heir after trans-
ferring the whole inheritance, though not fairly liabls to any
molestation or vexation on account of it, might find himself with
two lawsuits on his hands: he might first be sued by the creditore
of the estate, and then have to recover back what hs is condemned
to pay them from the transferres by suing him on the covenants of
quasi vendor and quasi vendes.

It is not surprising, therefore, that J ustinian abolished thess
provisions of the Sc. Pegasianum, and enacted that in every case
there shall be a transfer or division of actions as contemplated by
the Sc. Trebellianum, i. e. that the actions by or against the in-
heritance shall either be transferred in totality to the transferres,
or be maintainable by or against both the heir and the transferres
in the proportion of their interests.

The following observations may serve to complete the explanation
of the Sc. Trebellianum and the Sc. Pegasianum.

Succession is the transfer of a right from ons person (auctor) to
another person (successor), such as occurs, for instance, in the volun-
tary alienation of property. Here the same dominion that was
previously exercised by the alienor is subsequently exercised by the
alienes. The right continues the same; the person invested thers-
