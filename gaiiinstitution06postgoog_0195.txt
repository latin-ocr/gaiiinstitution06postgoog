seisin (delivery of possession), and though subsequently a deed was
always added, yet, originally, livery of seisin was a valid transfer
of property without an accompanying deed. There is this, however,
to be-observed, that in English law conveyance 'by livery was an
older title than conveyance by deed, whereas in Roman law man-
cipation, which we have assimilated to conveyance by deed, was
older than tradition3 and property in land, the great subject of ’
transfer by feoffment, was in Rome originally conveyed not by
tradition but by mancipation, tradition being, however, a further
requisite to effect the transfer of possession.

We proceed to notice minor points in the text of Gaius. We
have hitherto spoken of tradition as a title whereby property was
acquirffl. Tradition, however, was only an clement, usually the ’
final clement, of the complex mode of acquisition to which it gives
its name. To be capable of passing property, tradition must be ac-
companied by another clement, usually an antecedent element, some
contract or other source of obligation, or some evidence of intention
to aliene. The same was true of usucapion. Besides possession
for a certain term it was requisite that possession should have had
an innocent inception or belief of the possessor that he had a right
to take possession (bona fides). This second condition of acquisition
was indicated by the preposition pro governing a noun or participle ;
the bona fide possessor was said to possess pro emptore, pro donato,
pro legato, pro derelicto, Sne. The condition itself was called the
causa (ᾧ 20), οι· justa causa, or titulus, of the tradition or usucapion ς
and we now may notice the exact relation of the word Title as used
in this commentary to the Titulus of the classical jurists. Title, as
used by Austin aud as used in this commentary, denotes the totality
of the complex conditions to which the law annexes any right,
in rem or in personam: titulus as used by the classieal jurists is
only one portion of the modes of acquisition called Tradition and
Usucapion.

Instead of denoting the whole of a complex investitive fact, it

, denotes in their writings only a constituent part of this fact:

it merely denotes the fact by which the acquisition begins, as
contradistinguished from the fact by which the acquisition is
completed.
