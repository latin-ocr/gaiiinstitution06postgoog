ΤΕΒΤΑΜΕΝ TIFAOTIO.

§ 1 12. Sed senatus divo Hadriano
auctore, ut supra quoque siqnifioavi-
mus, mulieribus etiam coemptione
non facta testamentum facere per-
misit, ei modo maiores facerent an-
norum 1111 tutore auctore; scilicet
ut quae tutela liberatae non essent

ita testari deberent.

ξ 113. Videntur ergo melioris

etiamsi tutore auctore testamentum

§114 Igitur si quaeramus an
valeat testamentum, inprimis ad-
vertere debemus an is qui id fecerit
habuerit testamenti factionem: de-
inde si habuerit, requiremus an se-
cundum iuris civilis regulam testa-

years of age, only requiring their
guardian's authority if they were
still‘ m a state of pupilage.

ξ 1 14. Accordingly, to determine
the validity of a will, we must first
ascertain whether the testator had
testamentary capacity; next, if he
had, whether he conformed to the
requisitione of the civil law in its
execution, with this reservation‚
that soldiers, on account of their
extreme ignorance of law, as was
mentioned, are allowed to make
their wills in any way they like and

these would be the filiusfamilias, who could only dispose of his

peculium castrense and quasi castrense.
Testamentifaetio is a term applied, (A) to the Testator, Testa-

mentifactio activa3 (B) to the object of his bouuty, Testamenti-
factio passiva3 (C) to the witnesseS. Let us consider it in each of
