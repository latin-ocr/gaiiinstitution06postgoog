permittitur enim nobis a Praetore
ipsis iniuriam aestimare 5 et iudex
vel tanti condemnat quanti nos
aestimaverimus, vel minoris, prout

different: the plaintiff is permitted
by the praetor to put his own esti-
mate on the outrage, and the judex
may either oondemn the defendant

lesser sum at his discretion. Atro·
oions outrage, however, is generally
for the praetor to estimate; and
when he has onee fixed the sum in
which the defendant must give se·
curity to appear at the trial, the
plaintiff inserts the same sum in
the formula; and the judex, though
he has the power of condemning
the plaintiff m less, generally, out
of deference to the praetor, will not
venture to reduce the condemnation.

either by the aet, as when a man is
wounded, horse-whipped‚ or beaten
with a stick 3 or from the place, as
when an affront ia offered in the
theatro or the forum3 or from the
persons, as when a magistrate or
a senatlolxt· is insulted by one of infe·

a violation of the right to respect, honour, reputation3 sueh as libel,
malicious prosecution, assault and battery, and the like.

liable to a fourth aetion, on the part of the father of the husband.
In each of these actions the damages might be different, being
measured by the varying dignity of the party dishonoured by the

outrage.

Outrage, like thest, and robbery, and unlike damage under the
lex Aquilia, requires dolus malus, or unlawful design. In outrage,
as in other torts, the plaintiff had his option of proeeeding civilly

or eriminally, Inst. 4, 4, 10.
