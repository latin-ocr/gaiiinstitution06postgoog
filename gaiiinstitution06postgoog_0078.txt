privilege under that statute to
apply to the praetor, or, if he reside
in a province, to the president of
the province, and to prove that he
has conformed to the requirement
of the lex Aelia Sentia by marrying
a wife, and begetting by her a son
who has completed the first year
of his age: and thereupon is the
magistrate to whom the proof is
submitted pronounce the truth of
the declaration, that Latin and his
wife, if she is of the same condi-
tion, and their son, if he is of the
same condition, are declared by the
statute to be Roman citizens.

§3st The reason why I added,
when I mentioned the son, if of the
same condition, was this, that if the
wife of the Latin is a citizen of
Rome, the son, in virtue of the recent
senatusconsulta made on the motion
of the late Emperor Hadrian, is a
citizen of Rome from the date of
his birth.

ξ 31. This capacity of acquiring
Roman citizenship, though by the
lex Aelia Sentia exclusively granted
to freedmen who only became
Latius in consequence of being
under thirty years of age at the
time of their manumission, by a sub·
sequent senatusconsult, made in the
consulship of Pegasus and Pusi0, was
extended to all freedmen who acquire
the status of Latius, even though
thirty years old when manumitted.

ξ 32. If the Latin die before
proving the title of his son, on
his son's attaining the age of a
year the mother may prove the
title, and thereupon both she and
her son become citizens of Rome.
