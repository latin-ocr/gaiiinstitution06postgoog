DE OBLIGATIONIBUS.

tion to a superior, which may be classified with the status of familia
or domestic relations, It was a condition midway between freedom
and slavery. The colonus was liber and civis, but he was called by
the lawgiver servus terrae. He was inseparably bound to the soilz
a fugitive colonuS, like a fugitive slave, was said to commit a theft
of his own body, and he could be recovered by real action (vindi-
catio) from any one who gave him harbour. He had property, but
it was called peculium, and, though he could not be deprived of it
like the slave, yet he could not aliene it without the consent of his
lord. With certain exceptione, he could not maintain an action
against his lord‚ who was called his patronuS. Neither a colonus
nor his descendants could divest themselves of their hereditary serf-
dom. The colonus», having no Real right in the soil, paid no land
tax, but only a personal or capitation tax, like artisans and slaves.
As having· an inherited condition, the colonus or inquilinus was
called originarius3 as subject to the capitation tax he was called
tributarius, capite censituS, adscriptitius, censibus adscriptus. He
paid to his lord a certain annual rent (canon), usually in kind, and
always incapable of augmentation. This fixity of his rent was the
principal right which he enjoyed. See Savignyfs Vermischte
Schriften, 15. If, secking in Roman law for types of Feudal iu·
stitutione, we find the germ of frechold tenure in Emphyteusis,
the antitype of eopyhold tenure may similarly be discovered 'in
Colonatus.

DE SOCIETATE.

 

ξ 148. Societatem coire solemus
aut totorum bonorum, aut unius
alicuius negotii, veluti mancipiorum
emendorum aut vendendorum.

ξ 149. Magna autem quaestio
fuit, an ita coiri possit societas, ut
quis maiorem partem lucretur, mi-
norem damni praestet. quod Quintus
Mucius etiam concta naturam socie-
tatis esse censuit,- sed Servizw Sul-
picius, cuius praevaluit sententia,
adeo ita coiri posse societatem existi-
mavit, ut dixerit illo quoque modo
coiri posse, ut quis nihil omnino
damni praestet, sed lucri partem
capiat, si modo opera eius tam pre-
tiosa videatur, ut aequum sit eum

ξ 148. A partnership either ex-
tends to all the goods of the part-
ners or is confined to a single busi-
ness, for instance, the purchase and
sale of slaves.

ξ 149. It has been much can·
vassed whether the law would re·
cognize a partner-ship formed on
the ternis that a partner should have
a greater share in the profit than
he has in the loss. Quintus Mucius
thought such an arrangement con-
trary to the nature of partnership,
but Servius SulpiciuS‚ whose opinion
has prevailed, held that such a part—
nership was so far from invalid that
a partnership might be formed on
the terms that a partner should
