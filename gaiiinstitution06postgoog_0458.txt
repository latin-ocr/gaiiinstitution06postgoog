ᾧ 163. J ustinian enacted, as we have seen, that while the pecu-
lium profectitium of the filiusfamilias, that is, the peculium which'
he derived from the grant of his father, remained the property of
the father3 and while in respect of peculium castrense and quasi
castrense the son was paterfamilias, or absolute owner3 in respect
of peculium adventitium, that is, other peculium derived from any
other source than the estate of the father, only the usufruct or life
estate should vest in the father, the property or reversion remaining
in the son. In respect of tbe obligations acquired by the son, the
same principle was to prevail. Ut tamen quod per liberos quos in
potestate habetis ex obligatione fuerit acquisitum, hoc dividatur

perveniat, hujus usumfructum quidem habeat pater, proprietas
autem filio servetur, scilicet patre actionem movente, secundum
novellae nostrae constitutionis divisionem, Inst. 3, 28, pr. ‘ The
benefit of the obligations acquired by a son shall be divided‚ as his
property is by our constitution, into reversion and usufruct; so
that the proceeds of any action shall vest in the father for life, and
in the son in reversim, the whole right of action vesting in the
father, according to the distinctions expressed in the statute?

of SabinuS, Inst. 3, 28, 13.

To the persons through whom an obligation can be acquired
might be added the procurator in· the later stage of the law, as
