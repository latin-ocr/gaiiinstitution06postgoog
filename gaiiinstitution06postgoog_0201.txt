of an edifise, is at first sight very enigmatical. My right of
increasing the height of my building, and thus obstrueting the
lights of my neighbour‚ would seem to be part and parcel of my
unlimited rights of dominion: and, if a dispute arose, one would
think. that the burden of proof would be on my neighbour, who
would have to prove a special limitation of my rights as owner
of a praedium serviens and a special right residing in himself as
owner of a praedium dominans: that is to say, that instead of my
having to prove a servitude or jus altius tollendi, my neighbour
would have to prove a servitude or jus altius non tollendi. Cum
eo qui tollendo obscurat vicini aedes quibus non serviat nulla
competit acti0, Dig. 8, 2, 9. ‘ A man who by building obscures hia
neighbour's lights, unless subject to a servitude, is not actionable.’
Altius aedificia tollere, si domus servitutem non debeat, dominus
ejus minime prohibetur, Cod. 3, 34, 8. ‘ A man cannot be pte-
vented from raising the height of his house unless it is subject
to a servitude.’ The same rule is laid down in English law.
‘ By force of a grant or prescription a man may become entitled
to maintain his windows in freedom from all obstruction. But
in the absence of any grant and before the period has elapsed
which suffices for the establishment of a prescriptive claim, it is
competent to the owner of the adjoining land to construet a wall
or house on it so near to the former as to intersept the light which
it would otherwise have received3 for his right to erect edifices
on any part of his own soil is as clear as that of the first builder.'
Stephen, 1, 628. The following is the solution of the problem:
The extinction of Rural and Urban servitudes was governed by
different rules. The extinction of a Rural servitude was moro
easily accomplished than that of an Urban servitude: it was
effes-ted by simple non-user (non utendo) on the part of the
dominant owner for a period, originally, of two years, afterwards
of ten. 'Phe extinction of an Urban servitude demanded, besides
the negative omission of use on the part of the dominant, a posi-
’ tive possession of freedom (usucapio libertatis) on the part of the
servient owner. Gaius thus explains the differenee: in a servitus
ne amplius tollantur aedes, or ne luminibus aedium officiatur, if the
windows of the dominant house are closed with masonry there is
a non-usus of the servitude on the part of the dominant owner3
if in the same time the height of the servient house is raised there
is possession of freedom on the part of the servient owner. Or
