formula.

An explanation of the nature of Exceptions requires to be based on τ

8 review of the general incidente of litigation.

In every action there is some contentiori, allegation, or averment
of a plaintiff which is met or encountered by some contentiori,
allegation, or averment of a defendant.

The contention of the plaintiff (intentio) is the assertion of some
right of the plaintiff : e. g. in a real action, the assertion of do-
minion (si paret illam rem Auli Agerii esse): in a personal action,
the assertion of an obligation (si paret Numerium Negidium Aulo
Agerio illam rem dare facere oportere). In an action with a
formula in factum concepta there is an implicit or indirect assertion
of a right, although explicitly and directly the intentio only asserts
the fact which forms the title on which such right is founded.
In the wording of the formula the right of the plaintiff appears
as an hypothesis 3 because the formula or instruction to the judex
is a hypothetical command, expressed in a sentence of which the
intentio forms the antecedent or protasis, and the condemnatio the
consequent or apodosis.

'I'he contention of the defendant is either

(A) a NEGATION of the alleged right of the plaintiff, or

(B) an affirmation of a comnmo, countervailing right of the
defendant whereby the alleged right of the plaintiff is counterpoised
and counteracted.

'Phe denial of the plaintiff‘s right again admits of division:

1. It is either a simple and absolute negation of the plaintiff’s
right: an assertion of its non-existence even in the past: an
affirmation of its original nullity 3 or

2. A qualified or relative negation. Admitting or assuming that
it once existed, it is a negation of its present existence: an affirma-
tion of its subsequent destruction, nullification‚ or avoidance.

Accordingly a defendant had three lines of defence:

Ι. Τ116 assertion of the original NULLITY of the plaintiff's right.

This might be either a denial (traverse) of the fact, whether a
disposition or a trespass, on which the plaintiff's right was alleged
to be founded (general issue of English law).

Or the denial of the law by which such a right was said to be
