might even sue in his own name on the Cautio of a debtor by a
fictitious action called actio utilis. Here we may seem to have in
full bloom the institution of negotiable paper‚ that is, written pro-
mises to pay, transferable from person to person, and giving the
transferres a right to sue in his own name.

In the Roman practice, however, we are far from a complete
system of transferable obligation. The ceded or assigned obliga-
tion was never completely detached from the person and liabilities
of the preceding creditor. The cessionary or assignee was open to
all the exceptions that might have been opposed to the original
creditor: e.g. to compensatio, or reduction by the amount of a
counterclaim3 to exceptio non numeratae pecuniae, or plea of want
of consideration ; and to exceptio of lex Anastasiana‚ a statute which
prohibited any vendee of a debt from recovering, out of its nominal
amount, more than the price at which it was actually purchased.
And similar objections might be raised in respect of any creditor
intermediate between the original assignor and the final assignee.
The complete transferability of obligations was unknown to juris-
'prudence until modern legislation gave validity to contracts with an
incerta persona, i.e. with a person unascertained except as member
of a class; in other words, to papers payable to the Holder or Bearer.

In such papers, which are subjects of property or ownership‚ the
incorporeal obligation is, as it were, incorporated, and Obligation
is transformed into Dominion. We have instances of such papers
(called negotiable) in Promissory Notes‚ Bills of Exchange, State
obligations (documents expressing a claim against a government
for a certain amount of capital debt, and having annexed to them
eoupons, representing claims of periodic interest), and Debentures
of industrial corporations (certificates of Shares in such industria]
companieS‚ though similar to Debentures as entitling the Holder
to certain dividends or shares in the profits‚ are foreign to our
· present purpose, because they essentially and originally relate to
Property or jus in rem, not to Obligation or jus in personam, the
Shareholders being co-proprietors). By the use of such negotiable
papers the transferability of Obligation is raised to a level with the
transferability of Dominion, Savigny, Obligationenrecht, 62-70.

ᾗ 161. The doctrine of Sabinus that if an agent exceed his
powers in the price at which he purchases, the principal is not
bound for the purchase money even aster deduction of the un-
authorized excessi, was overruled, as we are informed by J ustinian.
