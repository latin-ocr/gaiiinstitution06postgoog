SACRAMEN TUM.

ξ 13. Sacramenti actio generalis
erat: de quibus enim rebus ut
aliter ageretur lege cautum nou
erat, de his sacramento agebatur.
eaque actio perinde periculosa erat
falsi nomine, atque hoc tempore
periculosa est actio certae creditae
pecuniae propter sponsionem qua
periclitatur reus, si temere neget,
et restipulationem qua periclitatur
actor, si non debitum petat: nam
qui victus erat summam sacramenti
praestabat poenae nomine: eaque
in publicum cedebat praedesque eo
nomine Praetori dabantur, non ut
nunc sponsionis et restipulationis
poena lucro cedit adversario qui
vicerit.

§ 14. Poena autem sacramenti
aut quingenaria erat aut quinqua-
genaria. nam de rebus mille aeris
plurisve quingentis assibuS, de mi-
noris vero quinquaginta assibus
sacramento contendebatur ; nam
ita lege ΧΠ tabularum cautum erat.

versia erat, etsi pretiosissimus homo

ξ 13. Sacramentum (Stake or
Deposit) was the general action,
for wherever no other mode was
appointed by law, the procedure
was by sacramentum. It was at-
tended with risk to the partieS,
like the modern aetion to recovcr
money lent, wherein the defendant
and plaintiff by the sponsio and
restipulatio respectively forfeit a
penal sum, if unsuccessful. The
praetor took securities for the
stake‚ which the vanquished party
forfeited to the treasury, not, as he
forfeits the penal sum of the modern
sponsio or restipulatiO, to the victor
in the suit.

§ 14. The penal sum of the sa-
cramentum was either five hundred
asses or fifty asses3 five hundred
when the subject of dispute was
valued at a thousand or upwards‚
fifty when at less than a thousand.
This was provided by the law of
the Twelve Tables. When, how-
ever, personal freedom was the sub-
ject of dispute‚ however valuable a
slave the man whose status was
litigatcd might be, the penal sum
was only fifty asses. This was en-
acted by the Twelve Tables in
favour of liberty, that the vindex
or assertor of liberty might never
be deterred by the magnitude of
the risk.

ξ 15. [When the sacramentum
was a personal action, that is to
say, instituted to enforee an obliga-
tion‚ after giving securities for the
stake, the parties left the praetor’s
court, having arranged to reappear
on the thirtieth day] to receive a
judex. When they appeared again
