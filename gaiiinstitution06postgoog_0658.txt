636 DE ACTIONIBUS. [Π. §§ 138-170.

the cross claims of the plaintiff and defendant should be identieal
in character. On the one side there might be a claim of status
(libertas), on the other of property (dominica potestas), one part-y
vindicating as free the person whom another claimed as slave: or
one party vindicating the freedom of a person whom another, as
transferee of patria potestas, claimed to be his bondsman (man-
cipium); or one party asserting the independence (sui juris) of
a person whom another claimed as filius familias or as subject to
patria potestas,

Similarly Hereditatis petitio would be judicium duplex; for
Hereditatis petitio is a species of Vindicatio.

Vindicatio and Hereditatis petitio are related to the actions
Communi dividundo and Familiae herciscundae as wholes to parts:
the former lay claim to integral ownership and integral succession
where the latter merely claim partial ownership and partial suc-
cession. The former became judicia simplicia in the later system
of law, while the latter remained judicia duplicia. Ibering, ᾧ 52.

In English jurisprudence both parties are said to be equally
plaintiffs and equally defendants in the actions called Quare impedit
and Replevin.

Uti possidetis was sometimes judicium simplex. We may dis-
tinguish three applications of this procedure:

(1) When both parties claim to be in actual possession and one
of them is found to be truly in possession without a taint of vio«
leuce, secrecy, or permission. Uti possidetis is then really an
interdictum Retinendae possessionis.

(2) When the possession of the actual possessor is found to be
vitiated by violence, secrecy‚ or permission, he is displaced, and
the non-possessor is reinstated. Uti possidetis is then in substance
and effect interdictum Recuperandae possessionis In both of these
cases it is judicium duplex.

(3) Uti possidetis might further be brought against a defendant
who made no contention that he himself was or ought to be in
possession, but who was guilty of some disturbance or molestation
of the possessor3 e. g. by prohibitio: Qui colere fundum prohibetur,
possidere prohibetur, Dig. 43, 17, 3, 4. Eum qui aedificare pro·
hibeatur‚ possidere prohiberi, manifestum est, Dig. 41, 3, 52, 1.
Etenim videris mihi possessionis controversiam facere, qui prohibes
me uti mea possessione, Dig. 43, 17, 3, 2. In this case Uti possi-
detis would be a judicium simplex. Uti possidetis in cases (2) and
