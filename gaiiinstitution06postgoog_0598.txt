576 ‚ DE ACTIONIBUS. [nv. ξς 103-109.

tween certain parties does not determine the rights of other
parties.'

This is subject to certain exceptione. For instance, a judgment
is conclusive not only against the parties but also against their suc-
cessorS‚ whether universal or particular, Cod. 8, 36, 2. A judgment in
a suit litigated by the father respectin g the status (legitimacy) of a
child is conclusive on all the world. A mortgagee, purchaser, hus-
band, are bound by the judgment in a suit litigated by the mortgsgor,
vendor, donor of dower, Dig. 42, 1, 63. A suit between a testa-
mentary heir and the heir by intestacy binds the legatees and the
manumissi who accordingly are entitled to be made parties and to
appeal. In these cases the judex is said to establish jus, i. e. jus
inter omnes, not merely jus inter partes: Placet enim ejus rei
judicem jus facere, Dig. 25, 3, 3, pr.: J us facit haec pronuntiatio,
Dig. 30, 1, 50, l.

The form of action is immaterial provided that the same right
is contested. Thus a depositor, lender, pledgor, may recover
damages for injury to the thing deposited, lent, or pledged,
either by action on his contract or under the lex Aquilia, but if
cast in one, he cannot bring the other.

It is otherwise if the right contested is really different3 if in one
action a plaintiff claims a jus in rem, in the other a jus in personam.
Paulus respondit, ei qui in rem egisset nec tenuisset, postea eon-
dicenti non obstare exceptionem rei judicatae, Dig. 44, 3, 31. ‘ If
a plaintiff after losing a real action brings a personal action, he is
not barred by the plea of previous judgment.'

'Phe term ‘ the same right ' must be taken to include a right and
its correlative obligation3 in other words, it is immaterial that the
position of plaintiff and defendant is inverted. Si quis rem a non
domino emerit, mox petente domino absolutus sit, deinde pooees-
sionem amiserit, et a domino petierit, adversus exceptionem: Si
non ejus sit res, replicatione hac adjuvabitur: At si res judicata
non sit, Dig. 44, 2, 24. ‘ A purchsser of a thing from a non-pro-
prietor, sued for it by the true proprietor and acquitted‚ asterwards
lesing possession thereof, and seeking (by actio Publiciana, 2 ξ 43)
to recover it from the former proprietor, may meet the exception
by which he pleads true dominion by the replication of previous
judgment.' This example further shows that the plea, though
invented chiefly to protect defendants‚ is sometimes available for
plaintiffs.
