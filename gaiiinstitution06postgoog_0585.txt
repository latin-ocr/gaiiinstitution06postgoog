DE SATISDATIONIBUS.

his own name, in a persona! action,
he only gives security in certain
cases named in the edict. These
cases are of two kinds, depending
either on ¹the nature of the ac-
tion or on the character of the de·
fendant. The nature of the action

he was not required. J ustinian relieved him of the necessity in
real actions.

In the time of Gaius if the defendant in a real action refused to
give security, judicatum solvi, the possession was transferred from ,
him to the plaintiff by the interdict Quem fundum, Quam here-
ditatem, or Quem usumfructum, as the case might be, and he was
reduced to the position of plaintiff. Sunt etiam interdicta duplicia
tam adipiscendae quam recuperandae possessioni83 qualia sunt
interdicta quma rennuit et QUAM nasanrrxrsu. Nam si fundum
vel hereditatem ab aliquo petam, nec lis defendatur, cogitur ad me
transferre possessionem, sive nunquam possedi, sive antea possedi

Civil Law. ⁴ Some interdicte may either initiate or restore posses-
sion, as the interdicte Quem fundum and Quam hereditatem. · For

security, he is compelled to transfer th'e possession to me whether I
never before had possession, or once had and afterwards lost posses-
