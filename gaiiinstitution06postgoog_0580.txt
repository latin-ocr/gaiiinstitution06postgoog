army, made a treaty with the Samnite3‚ and was sent under the
Caudine Forks, was surrendered by the Romane, to discharge them—
selves of their liability‚ with all the formalities of a noxae deditio,
Δ. D. 318, Livy, 9, 10. As Postumius had not committed a delict
against the Samnites, but had made a contract with them, we may
either suppose that the colouring of legality which the Romans
attempted to give to their violation of the treaty was defective in
this respect, or that under the old law the paterfamilias could really
ΒΥ noxae deditio discharge himself of liability for the contracts of
those in his power ΒΥ which he benefited, as well as for their delicts.

With the principle of noxal actions we may compare the law of
Damni infecti (damage anticipated), which allowed the owner of a
dilapidated house to exonerate himself from damages caused to his
neighbours’ property ΒΥ surrendering the house3 or the rule of
English law, by which the responsibility of a shipowner for damage
done without his fault to another ship or cargo was limited to the
value of his ship and the freight she was earning at the time,
53 Georgo ΠΙ, c. 159.

Mischief (pauperies) occasioned by an animal might ΒΥ a law of
the Twelve Tables be atoned for ΒΥ noxae deditio.
