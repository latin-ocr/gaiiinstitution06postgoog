tion. In Mandate, there is, on the one side, a promise to perform
something at the charqe and expme ‘ff α prinmpal .· on the other,
a grant of authority to deal with the property of the grantor to
a person who promises obedience to the instructions and devotion to
che interest& cf his principal. Here the italicized words show the
causal factors which the various unilateral dispositions require for
their support: and similarly all other unilateral pacts might be
shown to be dependent factors of compound bilateral transactione. ·

Each correlated unilateral disposition is both cause and effect.
Each is a lever by which the will of one of the contractors is moved.
Each is the efficient or motor cause of the other: and (as wills are
only moved by motives or ends) each is the final cause of the other.

Although they are thus reciprocally dependent, yet generally in
practice one habitually precedes, and thus appears to be the causal
factor3 while the one which habitually follows appears to be the
sequent or dependent factor. This is always the case in Real con-
tracts, where one disposition has always passed beyond the limits of
mere convention into an alienation of property (mutuum, nameless
contracts: do ut deS, do ut facias) : alienation of possession (pignus):
alienation of detention (depositum, commodatum): or performance
of service (nameless conti-acts: facio ut des, facio ut facias).

The Form of a disposition is what we have elsewhere (p. 10),
called its Declaration. All dispositions have two elements or
aspects, one external or corporal, the other internal or mental. In-
ternally they are the Intention of a disposer or disposers 3 exter-
nally they are the expression or manifestation of this intention.

Pomm contract separates the sequent from the causal {iactor
of a bilateral convention, clothes the intention in a strongly marked,
sometimes strangely charactered, externa] expression, manifestation‚
or roms, in exact conformity to the prescription of archaic law or
primeval custom, and thus constitutes a unilateral convention valid
by form. FORMLnss contract is bound by no requirement of Form
and has no validity in isolation from its cause. Fomml, conventions
from the separation or abstraction of the sequent from the causal
factor, are appropriately called asemon while for the opposite
reason roRMLEss conventions may be denominated cortem.

Abstract conventions sometimes contained in their fonnalities a
shadowy recognition of their departure from the concrete realities
of life—a confession· of the necessity of a supporting Cause in actual
commerce3 but sometimes contained no such avowal. Thus Nexum
