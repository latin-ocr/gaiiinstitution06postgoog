a trial by battle, the original method of deciding disputed rights;
and thirdly, the reference to peaceful adjudication. We may sup·
pose that on some memorable day in the progress of civilization,
before the combat had terminated fatall y to one of the combatants,
some Numa Pompilius, of sufficient authority to make so great an
innovation, interposed and induced the parties to refer the dispute
to arbitration. 'Phe case would afterwards serve as a model and
precedent to future litigants; but, from a superstitious fear of losing
the sanction of immemorial custom, the earlier stages of the pro·
cess would still continue to be unmieked in solemn pantomimo.
So, in English law, trial by Wager of battle, introduced by william
the Conqueror, was first partially superseded by the Grand assize,
or (rial by jury, an alternative substituted by Henry II, and was
finally abolished in the reign of George ΙΙΙ. ‘ The tenant [defen-
dant] shall not be received to wage battle, nor shall issue be joined,
nor trial had, by battle, in any writ of right? 59 Geo. ΙΙΙ, ch. 46.
The use of the rod or wand as representative of the spear, the
symbol of dominion, may be paralleled in English law by the deli-
very of a staff as the symbol of power and possession in the convey-
ance of copyholds. ‘ The conveyance of copyhold estates is usually
made from the seller to the lord or his steward by delivery of a rod
or verge, and then from the lord to the purchaser by redelivery of
the same in the presence of a jury of tenants,’ Blackstone, 2, 20.
Part of the proceedings in the sacramentum was a ceremony
denoted by the words manuum consertio. 'Phe Twelve Tables con·
tained the expression, Si qui in jure manum conserunt, which is
varied in a line of Ennius, Non ex jure manum consertum [vocant]
sed mage ferro Rem repetunt. An explanation of the variance is
given by Aulus Gellius, When land was the subject of contro-
versy, the praetor originally repaired with the litigants to the spot,
and they there performed in his presence (in jure) the ceremony of
manuum consertio. But when the Roman territory was extended,
the parties went without the praetor, each attended by his suit of
witnesses 3 and finally, even the departure of the litigants was
merely fictitiouS. This was the ease in the time of CicerO, who
gives the following fragments of the Sacramental procedure. He
gives them disjointedly, but they perhaps form successive portions
of the proceedings in a single action. Fundus qui est in agro qui
Sabinus vocatur . . . eum ego ex jure Quiritium meum esse aio . . .
Inde ibi ego te ex jure manum consertum voco . . ‚Unde tu me ex
