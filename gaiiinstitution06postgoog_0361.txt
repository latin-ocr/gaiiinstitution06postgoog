the Twelve Tables in default of sui heredes of the freedman‚ that
is to sa'y, in the rank corresponding to that which they gave to
agnatos in other successions', conferred the right of succeeding to
the estate of a freedman on the patron and such children of the
patron as continued in the civil family of their father.

(3) Tum quem ex familia (patroni proximum inveniam Ρ). Fail·
ing the patron and the patron’s children, the nearest agnatos of
' the patron were entitled to succeed.

(4) Unde liberi patroni patronaeque et parentes eorum. Failing
agnatos of the patron, his cognates in an ascending or descending
line were summoned to the succession.

(5) Unde vir et uxor.

(6) Unde cognati manumissoris. Failing the preceding titles,
the patron's collateral cognates succeeded.

If no one succeeded under any of these titles, the estate of the
deceased escheated to the treasury.

For this series of titles J ustinian substituted one far simplet,

though with some necessary modifications of signification, and
consisting of the following groups: (1) Unde liberi3 (2) Unde
legitimi 3 (3) Unde cognati3 (4) Unde vir et uxor.

'l'he first head includes all the natural descendants of the freed-
man or freedwoman, and excludes their adoptive children.

The second head entitles patrous and their natural children,
whether in their civil family or not; that is to say, it entitles
the patron and his children not, as formerly, in their character of
supposed agnates of the freedman‚ but in the character of his
supposed cognates.

The third head summons to the succession all the collateral cog-
nates of the patron, but only to the fifth degree. The freedman
himself, from the law's disregard of servile relationship, could no
more have cognates than he could agnates.

The augmented rights which the lex Papia conferred on patrous
against the estate of more opulent freedmen were abolishedj by J us·
tinian, except in the case of their testacy. If a freedman possessed
of a hundred aurei and upwards (this sum J ustinian considered
equivalent to the hundred thousand sesterces and upwards of the'
lex Papia) institutes a stranger as his heir (adoptive children being
