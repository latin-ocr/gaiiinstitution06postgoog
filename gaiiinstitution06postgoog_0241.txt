11. §§ 97-108.] DE TESTAMENTIS ORDINANDIS. 219

Festus. ‘ In contract or conveyance by bronze and balance, the oral
declaration shall have legal force,’) and had expressly recognized
in every paterfamilias a power of testamentary disposition (Uti
legassit snper familia, pecunia, tutelave suae rei, ita jus esto,
Ulpian, 11, 14. ‘ The directions of a testator respecting his family,
property, and the guardianship of his children, shall be carried into
effect).’

Q 103. The introduction of writing marks an era in mancipatory
wills. Originally, the testator gave oral instructions to the familiae
emptor in the presence of the witnesses respecting the distribution
of his estate. These oral instructions, forming the lex mancipii, or
conditions of the conveyance‚ were called the nuncupatio, After-
wards, for the sake of seeresy‚ the testator committed his inten-
tions to writing, and the nuncupation became a mere form of publi-
cation, or general ratification of the directions contained in the
tablets which the testator held in his hand. It was probably in
part, as Theophilus says, with the same view of concealing the
testator-’s intentione, that the familiae emptor was separated from
the heres, but in part also to enable the testator to institute as heres
a person who from infancy or any other disability was incapable of
co-operating in a mancipation.

ᾗ 105. Itis an intelligible mle, that a person interested in the
validity of a will should be incompetent as a witness3 and, when
the familiae emptor was the heir, it was reasonable to disqualify for
attestation any one united in interest to the familiae emptor. But
when the mancipation was purely fictitious (imaginaria mancipati0‚
Ulpian, 20, 3 3 imaginaria venditio, Inst. 2, 10, 1), and the imagi-
nary vendee distinct from the heir, the continuanee of this disqualifi-
cation shows the tendency of the Romans to venerate rules after the
principles on which they were founded had ceased to operate. In
the meantime the heir, who was really interested‚ was competent to
be a witness. Cicero, for instance, mentions that he and Clodius
were both witnesses to a will in which they were appointed heire,
Pro Milone, 18, 48. Thus the dispositione of the legislator were
deranged and stultified: totum jus conturbatum erat, Inst. 2,
10, 1οε the transference of interest from the familiae emptor to the
heres not being accompanied by a corresponding transferenoe of
testimonial disqualification from the relatives of the familiae emptor
to the relatives of the heres. J ustinian converted the advice of
Gaius into a rule of law, and disabled the heir and persons
