iure civili aut longius aut brevius
tempus dari: longius tamen inter-
dum Praetor coartat.

§ 171. Et quamvis omnis cretio
certis diebus constringatur, tamen
alia cretio vulgaris vocatur, alia
certorum dierum: vulgaris illa,
quam supra exposuimus», id est in
qua adiciuntur haec verba ε QUIBUS
scm'r rorm1roun; certorum die-
rum, in qua detractis his verbis
cetera scribuntur.

ξ 172. Quarum cretionum magna
differentia est. nam vulgari cretione
data nulli dies conputantur, nisi
quibus scierit quisque se heredem
esse institutum et possit cernere.
certorum vero dierum cretione data
etiam nescienti se heredem institu-
tum esse numerantur dies continui;
item ei quoque qui aliqua ex causa
cernere prohibetur, et eo amplius ei
qui sub condicione heres institutus
est, tempus numeratur. unde melius
et aptius est vulgari cretione uti.

ξ 173. Continua haec cretio vo-
catur, quia continui dies numer-
antur. sed quia tamen dura est
haec creti0, altera in usu habetur:
unde etiam vulgaris dicta est.

DE RERUM UNIVERSITATIBUS. [11. §§ 152-173.

a longer or shorter period is allowed
to be fixed, though a longer period
is sometimes shortened by the
praetor.

§17 1. Altbough, however, the
time of deliberation is always
limited to certain days, yet one
mode of limitation is called ordi-
nary, the other determinate3 the
ordinary being that above indicated,
namely, with the addition of the
words, ‘ after notice of institution
and available for declaration ;' de-
terminate that in which these words
are omitted.

§ 172. These modes are very
different in effect, for when the
ordinary period is allowed no days
are computed until the heir has
notice and is in a position to de-
cide, but when a determinate period
is allowed, notwithstanding the
heir’s want of notice of his institu-
tion, the days begin to be counted .
without intermission, and notwith-
standing his inability from any
cause to declaro, or any condition
annexed to his institution, neverthe·
less the days begin to be reckoned.
Accordingly, it is better and more
considerate to employ the ordinary
mode of limitation.

ξ 173. The determinate period is
called continuone, , because the days
are reckoned without intermission.
Because of the harshness of this
condition the other is commonly
employed, and hence is called or-

dinary.

ξ 152. 'I'he rules of institution and disinheritance were restric-
tions of the unlimited power of testamentary disposition confert-ed
by the Twelve TableS. The general tendency and purpose of
these restrictione are to protect children against the caprice of
parente, and to be fully comprehended they should be viewed
in connection with three other branches of law, the rules re-
specting· testamentum inofficiosum, the provisions of the lex
Falcidia and those of the senatusconsultum Pegasianum. All
