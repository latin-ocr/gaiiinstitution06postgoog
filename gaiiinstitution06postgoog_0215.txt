mortgagee‚ or otherwise. Vangerow, ᾧ 321. The Canon law requires
during the whole period of prescription the bona fides which the
civil law only requires at the inception.

J ustinian remodelled the law of Usucapion. For movables he
extended the period from one year to three years: for immovables
he abolished the distinction between Italian and provincial land,
and in every 6666 required ten years'· possession if the parties
were domiciled in the same province, and twenty years' possession
if they were not domiciled in the same province. Further,
he introduced a new usucapion (longissimi temporis praescriptio),
which was governed by less stringent conditions than the ordi·
nary usucapion (longi temporis praescriptio). It applied both to
movables and immovables‚ was not vitiated by certain flaws
in the subject (furtiva, violenta), and needed no support of any
titulus, but only required bona fides in its inception on the
part of the possessor, Cod. 7, 39, 8. It was completed in thirty
years.

Usucapion, particularly in this its later form, requires to be
carefully distinguished from the Limitation of actions (temporalis
praescriptio) with which it 1166 11666 coordinated by some civilians
'under the 66166 of Aequisitive, as opposed to Extinctive, Prescrip-
tion. We shall 666, 4 ᾧ 110, that all actions were originally
divided into temporales and perpetuae, temporales being such as
could only be brought within 6 certain period (e. g. in the case of
penal actions, a year) from the time when the right of action

Subsequently, however, even the latter were limited, and no action
could be brought after thirty years from the nativity of the action
or the time when the right of action accrued (actio nata). In· the
6666 of personal actions there 16 116 danger of confusing Usucapion
6611 Limitation. Usucapion implies possession, and in the case of
personal actions, or jus in personam, no such thing as possession is
conceivable‚ for possession only relates to the subjecte of jus in rem.
Usucapion and the Limitation of real actions are more similar, but
even here 6 distinction may be recognized. Limitation is the
extinction of 6 right by neglect of the person entitled‚ by his
omioeion to enforce his remedy: Usucapion is the acquisition of a
right by something positive 66 the part of the aequiter, his strictly
defined possession during 6 certain number of years, Even extra-
ordinary Usucapion requires, 66 we have seen, bona fides in the
