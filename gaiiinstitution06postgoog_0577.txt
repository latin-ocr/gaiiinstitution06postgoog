noxales actiones proditae sunt, uti
liceret patri dominove aut litis
aestimationem sufferre aut noxae
dedere: erat enim iniquum ne-
quitiam eorum ultra ipsorum corpora

§ 76. constitutae sunt autem nox-
ales actiones aut legibus aut edicto.
legibus, velut furti lege m tabu-
larum, damni iniuriae [velut] lege
Aquilia. edicto Praetoris, velut in-
iuriarum et vi bonorum raptorum.

ξ 77. Omnes antem noxales ac-
tiones capita sequuntur. nam si
filius tuus servusve noxam commis·
erit, quamdiu in tua potestate est,
tecum est actio 3 si in alterius
potestatem pervenerit, cum illo in-
cipit actio esse ; si sui iuris coeperit
esse, directa actio cum ipso est, et
noxae deditio extinguitur. ex di-
verso quoque directa actio noxalis
esse incipit: nam si pater familias
noxam commiserit, et hic se in adro·
gationcm tibi dederit aut servus
tuus esse coeperit, quod quibusdam
casibus accidere primo commentario
tradidimus, incipit tecum noxalis
actio esse quae ante directa fuit.

ξ 78. Sed si filius patri aut ser-
vus domino noxam commiserit,
nulla actio nascitur: nulla enim
omnino inter me et eum qui in
potestate mea est obligatio nascitur.
ideoque et si in alienam potestatem
pervenerit aut sui iuris esse coe·-
perit, neque cum ipso, neque cum
eo cuius nunc in potestate est agi
potest. unde quaeritur, si alienus
servus filiusve noxam commiserit
mihi, et is postea in mea esse
coeperit potestate, utrum intercidat
actio, an quiescat. nostri praecep-
tores intercidere putant‚ quia in
eum casum deducta sit in quo actio

father or master, who has the op·
tion of either paying the damages
assessed or surrendering the delin-
quent. For it is not just that the
misdeed of a son or slave should in-
volve the father or master in any
detriment beyond the loss of his

duced partly by law, partly by the
edict of the praetor: for theft, by
the law of the Twelve Tables ς for
injury to property, by the lex
Aquilia3 for outrage and rapine,
by the edict.

§⁷7. Noxal actions lie against
the lord or chief of the male·
factor. If your son or slave has
done a wrong while he is in your
power, an action lies against you;
if he becomes his own master, a
direct action lies against the of-
fender himself (ae his own lord), and
the noxal action is extinguished.
Conversely‚ a direct action may
change into noxal: if a pater-
familias has done a wrong, and
has become your son by adrogatio
or your slave, as 1 showed in the
first book might happen in certain
circumstances, a noxal action lies
against you in place of the direct
action which formerly lay against
the wrong-doer.

§78. But no action lies for an
offence by a 0011 or slave committed
against his father or master3 for
between me anda person in my power
there is no obligation; and, con-
sequently, if he pasees under the
power of another, or becomes his
own master, neither he nor his
master can be sued. Hence it 1100
110011 asked whether, if another
man’s son or slave has wronged me
and pasees into my power, the
aetion is extinguished, or is only in
abeyance. Our school maintains
that it is extinguished, because it
has come into a condition in which
