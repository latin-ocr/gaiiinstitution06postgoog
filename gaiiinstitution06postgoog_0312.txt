to enter into the covenants usual between an heir and a partiary
legatee. A partiary legatee is a legatee by partition, which Theo-
philus ealls a fifth form of legacy, and of which Ulpian gives the
formula: Sicut singulae res legari possunt, ita universarum quoque
summa legari potest, ut puta hoc modo: Heres meus cum Titio
hereditatem meam partito dividito, quo casu dimidia pars bonorum
legata videtur: potest autem et alia pars veluti tertia vel quarta
legari: quae species partitio appellatur, Ulpian, 24, 25. ‘ As single
things can be bequeathed, so can a universality, for instance thus:
Do thou, my heir, partition and divide my inheritance with Titius3
in which case a moiety is deemed to be bequeathed, but any other
part, a third or fourth, may be bequeathed‚ and this form of bequest
is called partition.’ This form of legacy probably owed its origin
to the lex Voconia, ᾗ 226.

ᾦ 257. It is therefore not true, as might be inferred from ᾗ 254,
that the stipulatione between quasi vendor and quasi vendee were
entirely discontinued. 'I'he reason why these obsolete oovenants

again became necessary is probably because the Sc. Pegasianum‚
having abrogated the Sc. Trebellianum in all cases where less than

a fourth of the inheritanee is left to the heir, had omitted to ‹leolare

what mutual securities were proper to be taken by the heir and

transferree, in ease the heir declined to avail himself of his right
to retain a fourth.

Modestinus suggested another course. He held that if the heir
declined to avail himself of his right, and transferred the whole
inheritance, there was no need of any stipulatione, as the Sc. 'Pre-
bellianum would then apply. However he thought the point
doubtful, for he recommended that the heir should feign unwil-
lingness to accept a damnosa hereditas, and should make a com-
pulsory acceptance by the order of the praetor, in which case the
actions are transferred in totality to the transferi-ee by the express
provision of the Se. Pegasianum, Dig. 36, 1, 45. The sequence
of §§ 257, 258 seems to indicate an intention of Gaius to suggest
that this course might be adopted.

ᾗ 258. The requirement for form’s sake of a compulsory aditio
and restitutio, instead of making the hereditas vest immediately
under the will in the fideicommissarius (the course pursued by the
legislator in the English statute of Uses and Trusts), has already
1 § 190, been noticed as characteristic of Roman jurisprudence.
It had this inconvenienee, that it permitted the truste to be defeated
