ιν. ξς llo-113] PRESCRIPTION. 581

Originally all rights of action were unlimited in duration (actio
perpetua) ; afterwards the praetore limited the right of bringing
some of the new actions which they introduced to the period of a
year from the date of the event on which the action was founded
(aetio annua). At some subsequent period longi temporis prae-
scriptio was introduced in suits relating to land: if plaintiff and
defendant were domiciled in the same province, ten years’ possession,
accompanied with justus titulus and bona fides on the part of the
possessor, deprived the plaintiff of his vindicatio: twenty years'
possession was required if plaintiff and defendant were domiciled in
different provinces, Indeed in provincial land such possession not
only founded a prescription, that is, deprived the owner of his right
of action, but operated as a usucapion3 that is, transferred the
ownership to the possessor. Constantino introduced a thirty years'
prescription: that is, ordained that an owner should lose his right
of action aster thirty years’ possession without either justus titulus
or bona fides on the part of the possessor. Theodosius ΙΙ, ΛΑ). 424,
extended this thirty years' prescription from real actionS, to which
it had hitherto been confined, to personal actions.

Justinian made longi temporis praescriptiO, that is, possession for
ten or twenty years, the universal mode of Usucapion for immo-
vables3 and added a second form called longissimi temporis
praescriptiO, or extraordinary prescription; ordaining that thirty
years’ possession without justus titulus, but accompanied with bona
fides, should transfer ownership to the possessor: and that thirty
years’ possession accompanied with mala fides should operate not as
usucapion but merely as prescription, Cod. 7, 39, 8.

Whether movables were affected by longi temporis praescriptio
is controverted, Vangerow, ᾧ 315: they seem to be included under
longissimi temporis praescriptio.

Iu the thirteenth century the canon law required as a condition
both of usucapion and of prescription, in all cases brought for re-
stitution of possession, continued bona fides (not merely bona fides
in the inception‚ as the civil law required for usucapion) on the
part of the possessor. This applied to the defendant in all real
actions and in various personal actions, viz. commodati, depositi,
locati, pignoraticia, or the action whereby a mortgagor recovcrs
possession of the thing he has mortgaged. Accordingly, by
canon law, the debitor rei alienae, as opposed to the debitor rei
propriae, had neither usucapion nor prescription in the absence of
