m. ξς 97-109.] PECUNIA NON NUMERATA. 389

burred by s plea of fraudulent intention. For though originally
the stipulation was not tainted with fraud, yet to sue on such
a stipulation is fraudulent.' The exception of dolus malus was
allowed by Marcus Aurelius (Aa). 169-176> to be pleaded in all
actions of civil law. Sed et in strictis judiciis, ex rescripto divi
Marci, opposita doli mali exceptione, compensatio inducebatur,
Inst. 4, 6, 30. ‘ Even in actions of civil law, after the rescript
of Marcus Aurelius, the plea of dolus malus forced the plaintiff
to recognize any set-off to his claim.'

If instead of generally alleging fraud (Si in ea re nihil dolo
malo Auli Agerii factum est neque fit), the plea alleged the par-
ticular fact of non-payment (exceptio in factum composita), it was
called exceptio pecuniae non numeratae. Compare Gaius, 4 ξ 116:
Si stipulatus sim a te pecuniam, tanquam credendi causa numera-
turus, nec numeraverim . . . . placet per exceptionem doli mali te
defendi debere, with Just. Inst- 4, 13, 2: Si quis, quasi credendi
causa, pecuniam stipulatus fuerit, neque numeraverit . . . . placet
per exceptionem pecuniae non numeratae te defendi debere.

An important peculiarity of these exceptione was that the burden
of proof was not, as in other exceptione, on the defendant, but on

 

the plaintiff. Si ex cautione tua, licet hypotheca data, conveniri .

coeperis, exceptione opposita seu doli seu non numeratae pecuniae,
compellitur petitor probare, pecuniam tibi esse numeratam; quo
non impleto absolutio sequetur, Cod. 4, 30, 3. ‘ If you are sued
on your stipulation (or written admission) confirmed by a mortgage,
the plea of fraud or money not received will force the claimant to
prove that the money was lent, or you will be acquitted.' A re-
script of Diocletian and Maximian (Aa). 286-305) expressly states
that this plea was admissible in sn action founded on stipulation.
Si stipulatione interposita placita creditor non dederit, in factum
esse dandam exceptionem convenit, Cod. 4, 30, 9. ‘ If, after a
stipulation, the contem plated loan was not advanced by the
promisee, this fact may be pleaded in an exception.'

It is clear that when these rules were established the nature of
verbal and literal contracts was deeply modified: , Formal con-
tracts were abolished, so far as thee rules extended, or transformed
into real contracts, the obligation of the promisor depending on
the performance of the promisee (re), that is, on the execution by
the promisee of his part of the consideration, not on the solemnity
of the spoken words (verbis) or written document (literis).
