2 PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS.

to unfolding the import of some of the pivot terms and most
pervading conceptions; and we shall find most of the definitione
we require already elaboratcd for us in the writings of Austin,
to whose valuable but unfortunately uafinished Lectures on J uris-
‘prudence 1 am indebted for many uf the definitions and divisione
that will 'be employed in this introduction.

A few definitions will suffice. 'I'he words which denote the
