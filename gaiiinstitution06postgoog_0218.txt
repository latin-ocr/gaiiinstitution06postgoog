general disposition of the legislator. But in acquisition by privi-
legium there is properly speaking neither title nor law. Law is
properly speaking a universal proposition, annexing a right or duty
to a title: it knows nothing of individual persone, but stops short
at classes of persons, classeS, that is, defined by the title. Again,
title is properly speaking a contingent fact distinct from a corre-
sponding law: a fact which may occur an indefinite number of
times, and entitle, that is, invest with rights or duties, an indefinite
number of persons, in accordance with the dispositions of one and
the same unchanging law. Tine, loosely and inaccurately defined
as a fact investing a person with a right, would include a privilege,
i.e. a law conferring a right immediately on a given individual
without the intervention of a fact distinguishable from the law:
but title, properly defined as an intervening fact through which
a law confers a right mediately, excludes privilege.

Whenever there is a genuine title and genuine law, the title is
interposed between the right or duty and the person therewith in-
vested, just as the middle term is interposed between the major and
minor terms of a syllogism. E. g. All persons marked, stamped,
characterized by a certain fact (B), are invested with a certain right
‘or duty (A); a given individua] person (C) bears the badge, mark,
or stamp of this fact (B); therefore this individual (C) is invested
with these rights or duties (A). A genuine law is only the major
premiss, the universal proposition, all B is A. The conclusion, C is
A, stating the rights or obligations of the individual, is a mediate or
dependent proposition, depending partly on the law and partly on an
independent fact, the minor premiss C is B, which osten requires to
be ascertained by judicial investigation. The condition, represented
by the middle term, which connects or disconnects the right or
duty, represented by the major term, with a person, represented by
the minor term, is the title. In a privilegium we have no such
premisses and no such middle term. 'Phe conjunction of C with A,
the investment of an individual with rights (or the disjunction of C
from A, the spoliation of his rights), is here an ungrounded pro·
position, unwarranted ΒΥ any recognized title; in other wordS, un-
supported by any subsumption of fact under law.

(2) In Bequest and Escheat and the succession of necessarius
heres there is a genuine law and a genuine title, but the law is not
the title, any more than it is in any other mode of acquisition.
