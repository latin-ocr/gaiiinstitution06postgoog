makes them difficult of proof. What
then is the result? If a claimant
demand bonorum possessio by iu-
testacy‚ and a devisee demand the
civil inheritance under the will, the
devisee must prevail in his suit, but
the treasury treats him as unworthy
and deprives him of the succession,
in order to carry the testator's in-

tention of excluding him into effect t
and this was enacted by a rescript
of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.

ξ 147. 'I'he validity of a testament implies, strictly speaking, the
continuance of the testator’s intention, and therefore of his capacity
of intention (testamentifactio)‚ from its first declaration to the
moment of his death. Accordingly an intermediate capitis diminutio
made the will invalid (irritum) at civil law. The praetor, however,
only looked at the first and last moments, and, if at these periods
the testator had testamentifactiO, sustained his intentione by grant-
ing juxta-tabular possession.

So at civil law a will was broken (ruptum) by aster-birth
(agnatio) of a self successor, ξ 138; but if he died before the
testator, the praetor sustained the will by granting juxta-
tabular succession to the heres scriptus. Postumus praeteritus,
vivo testatore natue, decessit. Licet juris scrupulositate nimiaque
subtilitate testamentum ruptum videatur, attamen si signatum
fuerit testamentum, bonorum possessionem secundum tabulas
accipere heres scriptus poterit, remque obtinebit, ut et divus
Hadrianus et Imperator noster rescripserunt, D. 28, 3, 12, pr. In
order that juxta-tabular succession, granted when a will had been
avoided (irritum) by intervening loss of capacity, might be efficacious
(cum re), i. e. not defessible by the claimant entitled at civil law by
intestacy, it was necessary that the testator on reacquiring capacity
should confirm his will by a codicil, D. 3⁷, 11, 11, 2.

ξ 148. There was no ipso jure, or necessarius, bonorum possessor,
corresponding to the heres necessarius, ξ 152, with whom delatio
and acquisitio hereditatis were coincident: all bonorum possessores
corresponded to the other class of heres, the heres extraneus or
voluntarius, with whom acquisitio was distinct from delatio here-
ditatis, and required a voluntary act (aditio). That is to say,
the person called (vocatus) by the praetorian edict to the succession
forfeited his right to succeed unless he made his claim (agnitio,
