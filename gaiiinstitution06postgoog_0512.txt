490 DE ACTIONIBUS. [1v. ἕξ 1-9.

illogical in allowing stolen property to be recovered ΒΥ Personal
action. No translation of property is operated by theft. Roman
law contained no disposition similar to that of English law, that
property in stolen goods is transmuted by sale in market overt.
Even in the hands of a third person, an innocent purchaser, the
thing remained the property of the original owner, exempt from
the potent chemistry of usucapion. It follows that the only action
logically competent to the proprietor who still remained proprietor
was a real aetion.

In the condictio ex causa furtiva, instead of the intentio, Si paret
dare oportere, ᾧ 4, which implies that the plaintiff’ is not- proprietor,
we might have expected him to sue with the intentio, Dare faeere
oportere, which might be merely a form of elaiming redelivery of
possession, and accordingly would be consistent with his proprietor-
ship.'1'he following ιε the explanation why the other formula was
allowed: A condictio certi for a certain sum of money was accom-
panied by a sponsio poenalis ιιι a third of the sum in disputo, to be
forfeited by the party who lost the action, 4 § 1⁷1. In order to
subject the thief to this further penalty, the legislator, at the eost
of an anomaly, permitted the plaintiff to sue with the formula, Si

'' '⁴ '⁴ paret dare oportere.

ᾧ 5. Condictio is an actio stricti juris, It excludes actions ex
fide bona (which had an intentio: Quidquid dari fieri oportet ex

‘ fide bona, § 47) actions ex delicto, and praetorian actions, or actions

in factum. It is divided into Condictio incerti, with an intentio
Quidquid paret dare facere oportere, and condictio certi, with an
intentiO, Si paret dare oportere. The latter is either brought to
recover a certain sum of money, and then is specially called Con-
dictio certi, or is brought to recover land or a slave or any other
certain thing, and then is called Condictio triticaria. 'I'he origin of
this name is doubtful. Petitio, sometimes equivalent to vindi-
catio, is sometimes also equivalent to Condictio certi. In both
cases it denotes the certainty and individuality of the property
claimed.

In condictio certi both the intentio (which names certa pecunia)
and the condemnatio are certae. In condictio triticaria the intentio
(which names some other certa. res) is certa3 the condemnatio (quanti
ea res erit) is incerta. In condictio incerti both intentio and con-
demnatio are incertae.
