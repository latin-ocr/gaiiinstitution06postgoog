600 DE ACTIONIBUS. [ιν. §§ .1 1 5-137.

law was attempted to be evaded, should be null and void: Nullum
contractum inter eos videri volumus subsecutum qui contrahunt,
lege contrahere prohibente . . . Sed et si quid fuerit subsecutum ex
eo vel ob id quod interdicente lege factum est, illud quoque cassum
atque inutile esse praecipimus, cod. 1, 14, 5. This rule will not
apply where a statute has expressly provided some other con-
sequence inconsistent with the nullity of the disposition. E. g. the
Sc. Macedonianum and Sc. Velleianum render the dispositione

which contravene them liable to ExceptiO, which is inconsistent
with nullification.

2. Examples of the second line of defence are in real action .

the averment of a subsequent loss of dominion by dereliction or
usucapion or alienation, or loss of servitus by non-usus: in here-
ditatis petitio the avoidance of a valid will ΒΥ agnatio postumi or
by the execution of a later will ε in personal action the extinction
of a debt ΒΥ solutio, acceptilatio (formal release), novatio.

In general, the avoidance of a right may either be produced by
the very dispositioh by which the right is originated, viz. ΒΥ the
fulfilment of a resolutive condition which it contains: or ΒΥ some-
thing external, e. g. adjudication, when res judicata operates not as
a counteractive but as an extinctive plea, 3 ᾧ 18οε or by a con-
trary disposition, e. g. dereliction of property, repudiation of the
delatio of legatum or hereditas, In respect of contrary dispo-
sitions the general rule obtains that to produce complete invalidity
the second disposition must be of similar form to the first3 other-
wise it only produces incomplete invalidity (exceptio, a counteractive
plea): Nihil tam naturale est, quam eo genere quidque dissolvere,
quo colligatum est: ideo verborum obligatio verbis tollitur: nudi
consensus obligatio contrario consensu dissolvitur, Dig. 50, 17, 35.
Thus, a stipulation is extinguished by a formal release (accepti-
latio) but only counteracted by an informal release (poetum de
non petendo). However, furtum ,and injuria were extinguished ΒΥ
nudum pactum, in spite of the dissimilarity of disposition and
tort: Quaedam actiones per pactum ipso jure tolluntur, ut in-
juriarum item furti, Dig. 2, 14, 17, 1: and an informal release
-followed by an informal revocation (pactum de petendo) is not
extinguished but only counteracted, 4 ᾧ 126, and Dig. 2, 14, 27, 2.

Let us consider what is the effect when a valid disposition is
followed not by a contrary disposition but by some other circurn-
stanee of an adverse or inconsistent character. Some jurists laid
