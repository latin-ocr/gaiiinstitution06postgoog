The actio Serviana here mentioned was apparently not the same
as the actio Serviana whereby a lessor could recover the goods of
a colonus which had been pledged as a security for the payment of
rent.

ῧθὸ. Α Quintus Publicius is mentioned by Cicer0, Pro Cluenti0,
45, as praetor in B.c. 66 or shortly before. 'Phe actigssssubliciana,
2 ξ 41, was used by the purchaser of a res mancipi who had taken
{ample d—elivery what could only be conveyed by mancipation; or
by a grantee from a grantor who was not proprietor. The abolition
of the distinction of res mancipi and nec mancipi and of quiritarian
and bonitarian property would render the action unnecessary in the
first of these cases and probably in many cases of the second clasS.
In the terms of the edict, Si quis id quod traditur ex justa causa
non a domino et nondum usucaptum petet, judicium dabo, Dig.
6, 2, l, the words ‘ non a domino‚' which limit its application to the
second class, were probably intercalated by J ustim'an. But the
action would also be convenient to an actual proprietor who wished
to be relieved of the necessity of proving his title.

The form of the actio Publiciana that we have considered pro·
ceeds on the supposition of the accomplishment of a non-accom-

plished usucapio. Some writers, misled by Dig. 44, 35, ⁵7, pr.‚
have imagined the existence of another form of Publiciana, which
they call contraria Publicianae or Publiciana rescissoria, proceeding
on the supposition that an accomplished usucapio had not been ac-
complished. But Savigny has shown, ᾗ 329, that this is erroneous:
that when usucapion is rescinded in Integral Restitution on account
of Absence, the action whereby the plaintiff recovers his property
may be, according to circumstances, either an ordinary Publiciana
or an ordinary vindicatio, Inst. 4, 6, 5 : that the rescission of
usucapiO, in other words, does not give birth, as supposed, to any
new form of action.

ᾗ 38. By a positive rule, of which we are unable to give the
rationale [l §162‚ com.], the change of status produced by coemptio
and adrogatio extinguished the debts of the wife or adrogatus, and

the husband or adrogator acquired by manus and patria potestas ζ

their rights without their liabilities. 'I'o meet this the praetor gave
the creditor an actio-rescissoria : Ait praetor: qui quaeve, posteaquam
quid cum his actum contractumve sit, capite deminuti deminutaeve

esse dicentur, in eos easve quasi id factum non sit judicium dabo,
Dig. 4, 5, 2. If the action was not defended by the husband or
