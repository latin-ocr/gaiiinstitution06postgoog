14 PRELIMINARY DEFINI'PIONS.

consequences of his act, if his ignorance proceeds from thoughtless-
neSS, recklessnesS, carelessness, want of due attention. Negligence
is inadvertence to consequences to which a man might have ad-
verted, and to which he would have adverted had be been desimus
to obey the law and perform the obligations which it imposeS. As
obligation may either consist in performance or forbearance, so the
negligent breach of obligation, which we have always spoken of
hitherto as if it always consisted in commission‚ may be either
commission or omission. The word Negligence, indeed, most
properly designates inadvertence to the consequences of omission
or inaction. Inadvertence to the consequences of commission may
be called heedlessness If the mischievous consequences of an act
are adverted to, but on insufficient grounds are not expected to
follow, the neglect of precaution is called temerity or rashneSS.

The foregoing definition of Intention agrees with that given by
Aristotle, except that, instead of singling out one clement, the
consequences, as the object of consciousness, he requires that all the
elements of an action, the consequenceS, the degree of force, the
instrument, the patient or subject, the agent, the act, should be
present to the mind of the actor, in order-to make his conduct
intentiona13 although of these ingredients the consequences are
admitted to be one of the most important. ὄντος δ’ ἀκουσίου τοῦ
βιαίου καὶ δι’ ἄγνοιαν, τὸ ἑκούσιον δόξειεν ἂν εἶναι οὗ ἡ ἀρχὴ ἐν αὐτῷ,
εἰδότι τᾶ καθ’ ἕκαστα ἐν οἷς ἦ πρᾶξις, Ethica Nicomachea, 3, l, 20.
(So far the definition only includes the Intentional. To make it
coextensive with the Imputable we must complete it ΒΥ adding
καὶ ὅσα δι’ ἀμέλειαν ἀγνοεῖν δοκοῦσιν, ibid. 3, 5, 9, or, καὶ ὅταν ἐν
ἑαυτῷ ἡ ἀρχὴ ᾖ τῆς ἀγνοίας, ibid. 5, 8, 7). ‘That is involuntary
(unimputable) which is caused ΒΥ external compulsion or by igno-
rance. That is Voluntary (imputable) whose cause or beginning is
internal (Will, Volition) with a knowledge of the individua] ingre·
‹lients which constitute the action, or without this knowledge, if
the ignorance is produced ΒΥ negligence—if the agent is to blame
for his ignorance.’ Or we may make the Voluntary inclusive of
Negligence and coextensive with the Imputable by dividing Know-
ledge, with the writer of the Eudemian Ethics, into actual know-
ledge, and possible knowledge. ἐπεὶ δὲ τὸ ἐπίστασθαι καὶ τὸ εἰδέναι
διττόν, ἓν μὲν τὸ ἔχειν, ἓν δὲ τὸ χρῆσθαι τῇ ἐπιστήμῃ, ὁ ἔχων μὴ χρώμενος
