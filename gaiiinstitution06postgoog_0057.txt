1. §§ 1-7.] DE JURE GENTIUM ΕΤ OIVILI. 35

Cod. 6, 23, 3, was called by later jurists lex regia, in memory of
the lex curiata, whereby the kings were invested with regal power.
The king was proposed by the senate and elected by the Comitia
Curiata, and the election was ratified in a second assembly pre-
sided over by the king3 e. g. Numam Pompilium regem, patribus
auctoribus, sibi ipse populus adscivit, qui ut huc venit, quanquam
populus curiatis eum comitiis regem esse jusserat, tamen ipse de
suo imperio curiatam legem tulit, Cic. De Republ. 2, 13. A frag-
ment of a bronze tablet, on which was inscribed the lex investing
Vespasian with sovereign powers, was discovered at Rome in the
fourteenth century, and is still preserved in the capitol.

ᾧ 6. ΑΗ 1116 higher magistrates of Rome were accustomed to
issue edicts or proclamations. Thus the consuls convoked the
comitia, the army, the senate, by edict: the censors proclaimed
the approaching census by edict: the ediles issued regulations
for the market by edict: and magistrates with jurisdictioni pub·
lished edicts announcing the rules they would observo in the
administration of justice, the Edicts of the Praetor urbanus,
Praetor peregrinus, Aedilis curulis being· called Edicta urbana,
while the Edicts of the governors of provinces were called Edicta
provincialia. These edicts, besides being orally proclaimed, were
written on white tablets (in albo) and suspended in the forum·
apud forum palam ubi de plano legi possit, Probus,‘ in the forum
in an open space where persons standing on the ground may read?
Such 611 edict was always published on entering on office (est enim
tibi Jam, cum magistratum inieris 61 111 concionem adscenderis, edi-
cendum qnae sis observaturus injure dicendo, Cic. De Fin. 2, 22),
and was then called Edictum perpetuum, as opposed to occasional
proclamatione, Edictum repentinum. A clause (pars, caput, clau-
sula, edictum) retained from a former edict was called Edictum
tralatitium, Gellius, 3, 18; and though doubtless the edicts gradu-
ally changed according to changing emergencies, each succeeding
praetor with very slight modificatione substantially reproduced the
edict of his predecessor. In the reign of Hadrian the jurist Salvius
Julianus, called by J ustinian Praetoriani edicti ordinator, reduced
the edict to its definitive form, and if the yearly publication was
not discontinued (cf. Gaius, jus edicendi habent), at all events
Julian's coordination of Praetorian law was embodied in all subse—
quent publications. Such was the origin of J us honorarium (prae-
torium, aedilicium), as opposed to J us civile: and from what has
