liberam bonorum administrationem consequuntur. Hac ex causa,
licet non sint heredes instituti, tamen domini sunt, nec obstat,
quod licet eos exheredare, quos et occidere licebat, Dig. 38, 2, 11.
‘ In aelf-succession we have a still more striking instance of an
unbroken continuity of dominion, for there appears to be no vaeting
of new property by descent, but the heir is deemed to have been
previously proprietor even during the lifetime of the father. Hence
the names filiusfamilias and paterfamilias, implying a similar legal
relation to the patrimony, though one is parent and the other child.
Therefore the death of the parent occasions no acquisition of new
property ΒΥ descent, but only an increased freedom in the adminis-
tration of already existing property. Hence, even in the absence
of testamentary institution, a sels-successor is proprietor: and it
. is no objection to this, that a parent has the power of disin-
heriting a sels-successor, for he also had the power of putting him
to death?

The characteristic of the Roman will that it grounded a Universal
succession (unlike the English will which may be a merely Partial
definition of the succession), which is expressed in the maxim:
Nemo pro parte testatus, pro parte intestatus decedere potest, had
its historie origin, not probably in a perception of its manifold
utffity, but in the primitive form of the will—a proposal laid
before the legislative assembly for its sanction, ξ 101. The as-
sembly could no more judge of the justice of a proposed arrange·
ment without having laid before it the whole plan of suecession
than it could judge of the fairness of a contract ΒΥ inspection of
a single paragraph. It could not therefore allow the testator
merely to lay before it certain partial modificatione of the intes-
tate succession and leave the rest of his inheritance to follow the
general rules of intestacy, without further informing the assembly
of their operation. This consideration involves the rules respecting
the effect of Praeteritio. If the testator's dispositione were valid
in spite of PraeteritiO, he would have it in his power to commit
a fraud upon the assembly by suppressing some element that was
material to enable them to form a judgment. Accordingly Prae-
teritio was made to defeat itself, in the case of the son by nulli-
fication (inutilitas), in the case of other issue ΒΥ Aceretio, ξ 124.

After the introduction of the mancipator-y will the fraud against
the legislature would cease to be a motive for the rule requiring-
the testator to define a Universal succession3 but 'the rule was
