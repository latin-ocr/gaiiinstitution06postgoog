586 DE ACTIONIBUS. -[1v. ξς llo—113.

(vindicatio) is, that the right of the original owner continues but
is not ground to support an action against the mala fide possessor
or his successor. If the thing pasees into the possession of a
stranger, then the original owner can recover it from him by
vindicatio: and if it comes by lawful means into the pooeession of
the original owner, the mala fide possessor cannot recover it from
him by vindicatio, Cod. 7, 39, 8, l. In the event of bona fides
there could be no question of prescription3 because then, as we have
seen, the very jus of the original owner would have been extin-
guished. In real actions, then, prescription has the weaker
operation.

The effect of prescription in personal actions is controverted.
Savigny holds that the stronger effect is confined to exceptione
founded on jus naturale3 and that prescription being, as shown by
its arbitrary numerical character, an institution of jus civile, can
only have the weaker operation, i. e. leaves untouched the obligatio
naturalis, ἕ 249. Vangerow, however, seems to show conclusively,
ἦ 151, that this doctrine is not tenable. Although the old insti·
tution of pendency-limitation or, process-prescription, mentioned
by Gaius, 4& 104, had only the weaker operation (quia naturale
debitum manet, Dig. 46, 8, 8, 1), many passages of the Digest
show that in temporal actions prescription of right to sue had
the stronger operation, excluding fidejussio, Dig. 46, l, 37, and
constitutum, Dig. 13, 5, 18, 1, and admitting condictio indebiti,

p Dig. 46, 8, 25: and there is no reason why its operation should

not be equally strong in perpetual actions. Indeed the very object
of prescription, the setting of some limit to the duration of un-
certainty, would be defeated· if a creditor were allowed to enforce
by Compensation a claim that for an indefinite period he had not⁴
attempted to enforce by action. Prescription, then, in all personal
actions has the stronger operation. (English law seems to differ, at
least so far as it recognizes a debt made irrecoverable by the statute
of limitatione as a sufficient consideration to give legal force to the
debtor’s promise to pay: for, in the absence of all legal obligation,
a mere moral obligation would admittedly not suffice to bind the
debtor before the tribunals.)

Has prescription the same effect upon the grounds of defence
(Exceptions) that it has upon the grounds of attack (Actions): can
there be temporis Replicatio as well as temporis Exceptio ἲ This
depends upon the nature of the exception. Exceptions are
