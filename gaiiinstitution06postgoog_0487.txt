111.§209.] DE VI BONORUM RAPTORUM. 465

'l'he party aggrieved might either proceed by civil action or by
criminal prosecution under the lex J ulia de vi publica et privata.
This law, enacted either by Augustus or by Julius Caesar, made
the criminal guilty of public or armed violence, liable to depor-
tation; the criminal guilty of private or unarmed violence, to
confiscation of a third of his goods, Inst. 4, 18, 8.

'Phe quadruple damages in the civil action of rapine were not
purely penal as in the action of furtum manifestum, but included
the restitution of the property or its value. 'I'he penal damages
for rapine were therefore only three times the value of the goods
plundered, that is, less than the damages in furtum manifestum.
If, however, the robber was taken in the act, he was chargeable,
as Gaius explains, with furtum manifestum.

The lex Cornelia repetundarum passed by the dictator Sylla,
B.o. 81, instituting a criminal action against governors of provinces
guilty of extortion: the formula Octaviana or aetio quod Metus causa,
introduoed by the praetor Octavius, father of Augustus, B.0. 7 9 e and
the actio Vi bonorum raptorum, introduced by the praetor Lucullus,
B.c. 77, all fall within the space of four years and indicate the
lawlessness generated by the civil wars in the time of Sylla.

Robbery‚ like theft, requires dolus malus, that is, criminal inten-
tion. If then a man, believing· himself to be rightful owner,
violently invaded lands or violently seized movable goods, he was
not guilty of robbery3 but, by a constitution of the emperors
Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius, enacted Aa). 389, in order to
repress violence, and deter people from taking the law into their
own hands, the offender, if rightful owner, forfeited the property
to the person dispossessed 5 if not rightful owner, was condemned,
besides restitution of possession, to forfeit the value of the property,
Cod. 8, 4, 7. This constitution increased the civil penalty recover-
able for violent dispossession by the interdict unde vi, 4 § 154.
By the interdict unde vi no penalty was originally recoverable for
violent, but unarmed, dispossession of 000 whose own possession
was tainted by an origin, violent, clandestine, or permissive: and
for either armed or unarmed dispossession the penalty, as far as the
property in question was concerned‚ was only restitution of pos-
session. By the constitution of the three emperors the civil penalty of
an violent disseisin was loss not only of possession but of property;
and subsequently to this constitution the interdict unde vi ceased to

make a distinction between armed and unarmed dispossession.
