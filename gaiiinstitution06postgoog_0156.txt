194 DE PERsoms. [1. ξς 165-172.

ᾧ 167. It seems anomalous that a Latin, i.e. a non-civis, should,
have been a subject of wardship ε for as tutela is an institute ofjus
civile (ξ 142, commentam), i.e. jus civium, we should have expected
that, as in the case of patria potestas, both pater and filius must be
cives Romani, § 128, so here both parties, the ward as well as the
guardian, must of necessity be cives Romani. The anomaly, how-
ever, was expressly enacted by the lex J unia: which further de-
parted from the law of the Twelve Tables by separating the
guardianship from the right of succession 3 for it gave the guardian-
ship to the quiritary owner, but the right of succession to the boni-
tary owner. Latinus was not only capable of being a ward, but
also of being a guardian, Fragmenta Vaticana, 1933 that is, though
he was incapable of being a testamentary guardian, ξ 23, he could
be made a tutor dativus, or appointed by a magistrate,§ 185. This
magisterial disregard of the spirit of the lex J unia is similar to the
praetor’s behaviour in respect of another of its dispositione. The
law disabled Latins from taking as devisees or legatees under a
will 3 the praetor allowed them to take by means of a declaration of
trust, ᾧ 24.

ξ 168. Τ116 reason given for the non-assiguability of guardian·
ship of infante will vary according as we read, Quia non videtur
lucrosa. or, Quia non videtur onerosa. In English jurisprudence
· guardianship is said not to be capable of assignment or transfer,
⁷ because it is not a right but a duty.

ᾗ 172. Τ116 question whether a guardian was statutory or
fiduciary might be of importance, as it affected the rights of the
ward, ᾗ 194. It is clear that the natural father was statutory, not
fiduciary, guardian, for it is incredible that the remancipation to
the natural father, ᾧ 134, was accompanied by a fiducia. The sons of
the natural father might have been expected to become statutory
guardians, like the sons of any other patronus, but we find that
they were only deemed to be fiduciary guardiam, ᾗ 175. J ustinian
assigns as a reason why the sons were only fiduciary guardians the
fact that a slave, if not manumitted by the father, would have
become the slave of the sons, Inst. 1, 19 3 from whence we may con-
clude, if his reasoning is logical, that a bondsman, if not manu-
mitted, would not become the bondsman of the son of his lord: in
other words, that the death of the father extinguished the status of
bondage. But I am not aware that this incident of bondage is

elsewhere mentioned5 and if it explains why the son of the emanci-
