430 DE oBLleATIonUs. [111. §§155-162.

Another case in which a guarantor and guarantee stand in the
relation of mandant and mandatary is DELEGATIO. Tua et mandantis
gratia intervenit mandatum, si mandet tibi, ut ipsius periculo
stipuleris ab eo quem tibi deleget in id quod tibi debuerat, Inst. 3,
26, 2. ‘ Both the agent and the principal are beneficially interested
in a mandate if the principal directs the agent at the risk of the

³ principal to take a verbal bond from a debtor of the principal in

discharge of a debt due from the principal to the agent? The
result of this transaction‚ compounded of mandate and stipulation,
would be two novationS, extinguishing the original debts due to
Δ and from the principal‚ and creating a new liability of the principal
as guarantor of the substituted debtor‚ Delegare est vice sua alium
reum dare creditori vel cui jusserit, Dig. 46, 2, 11. ‘ To delegate
is to give in one’s stead a vicarious debtor to one's creditor 01 his
order.’ Quod mihi ab aliquo debetur, id si velim tibi deberi . . .
opus est ut jubente me tu ab eo stipuleris3 quae res efficit ut a me
liberetur et incipiat tibi teneri, quae dicitur novatio obligationi3‚
Gaiae, 2 ξ 38. ‘The transfer osa debt requires that on the order
ofthe transferror the transferres should stipulate payment from the
debtor‚ whereupon the debtor is discharged of liability to the trans-
ferror and becomes bound to the transferree, which change is called
NOVATION’ (p. 399). In this Roman practice of dischargiug liabilities
substitution of another person as debtor‚ of which we have already
had an example in the form of literal contract called transcriptiO,
we may see a parallel to the modern practice of discharging debts
by means of bills of exchange.

Mandate might be employed to operate a virtual transfer of
obligation, without Delegation 01 Novation, which was not always
practicable as it required the concurrence of the debtor‚ by cnsslo
Ac'rloNUM—the mere transfer of the right of action (mandare, cedere,
praestare actiones). 'I'he transferror made the transferree his pro-

cessual representative and that on the transferree’s own account ,

(procurator in rem suam) : that is, gave him a procuration or power
of attorney‚ which enabled him to sue either entirely in the name of
the transferror, 01, employing the formula Rutiliana, partly in the
name of the transferror and partly in the name of the transferree,
naming the transferror in the intentio and the transferree in the
condemnatio, 4 ᾧ 35: and in eit-her case entitled him to retain
whatever sum he recovered.
