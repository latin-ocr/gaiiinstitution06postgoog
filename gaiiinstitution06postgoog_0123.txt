married women had once been recognized, simulated or fictitious
marriage (coemptio) was employed as an artifice for giving testa-
mentifactio even to unmarried women, and certainly not in the
interest of their agnateS.

The origination of Manus by length of continuone possession
(usus), i. e. ΒΥ usucapio, shows plainly enough that early Roman
law regarded the wife as a mere chattel of the husband. The law
of the Twelve Tables allowed the wife to bar this usucapion by an
absence for three whole nights in each year. A movable day
consists of 24 hours measured from any given moment. A calendar
day consiste of 24 hours measured from midnight to midnight. A
year consists of 365 days; a movable year begins on any given day,
a calendar year on the lst J anuary. The wife’s interruption of
the husband’s usucapio seems a fitting occasion for some explanation
of the different modes of measuring time in Roman jurisprudence.

There were three modes of computing a movable year.

(1) computatio naturalis. A year beginning at a certain bour of a
certain day of a certain mont-h ends at the same hour of the same day
of the same mouth when they next recur on the calendar. Thus a
year beginning at 11 a.m. 1 Jan. 1800 is completed at 11 a.m.
1 Jan. 1801. This mode of computation is said to be ad momenta,
by momente (computatio a momento ad momentum), where momenta
as opposed to dies means honre, minutes, seconde, i. e. any sub·
divisione of the day. This mode of computation, requiring exact
chronometric instruments, is quite exceptional in Roman law, and
is only expressly applied to the determination of Majority or the
age of 25 year-S, D. 4, 4, 3, 3. Thus a man born 11 a.m. 1 Jan.
1800 attains his majority at 11 a.m, 1 Jan. 1825, and if he makes
any contract at 10 a.m. of that morning is entitled to restitution
as a minor. Savigny supposes that the same rule would ΒΘ applied
in determining the limits of tutela and curatela.

Computatio civilis. The imperfectiori of chronometric instrumente
caused the subdivisione of the day to be neglected in ordinary legal
computations and only whole days to be counted: in other words
the jurist only regarded calendar dayS, 24 hours from midnight to
midnight, not movable days, 24 hours beginning and ending at any
moment. Accordingly the first day of the year was always assumed
to have begun at the first moment of the calendar day, but the
treatment of the last day varied.
