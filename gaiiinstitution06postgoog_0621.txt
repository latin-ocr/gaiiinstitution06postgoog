1v. §§ 115-137.] NULLITY. 599

ΒΥ allegation of the infancy or lunacy of an alienor or contractor.
In hereditatis petitio, the original nullity of a will is pleaded‚ or
the plaintiff's testamentary title is avoided, by avet-ment of the
preterition by the testator of a suus heres. A title by contract is
avoided by indicating a limitation in respect of time or place or

condition or alternative.
In general the grounds of the original nullity of a disposition are

either:
(a) Want of the conditions necessary to its validity, whether from
absence of the personal qualities required in the disposer, or 'from

absence of the intention which is of the essence of a disposition,
p. 9, or from absence of the prescribed form in which an intention

is required to be declared.

(b) Or prohibition of the disposition by positive law.

The antagonism of the legislator to a kind of disposition expressed
itself in various ways:

(1) He imposed difficult or inconvenient forms as conditions of its
validity. Such a requirement is perhaps what Ulpian, 1, 1, de-
nominates an imperfecta lex: it is exemplified ΒΥ lex Cincia.

(2) He prohibited a disposition but, instead of declaring it invalid,
imposed a penalty on the person ΒΥ whom it was enforced. This

was the method of lex Furia testamentaria, which Ulpian quotes as ² ’

an example of minus quarn perfecta lex.

(3) He prohibited a disposition but only struck it with a partial
invalidity: he allowed it to create a valid right, but made such right
subject to be deprived of its efficacy ΒΥ ExceptiO. Such an ex-
ceptio might be of the weaker class, only barring obligatio civilis,
e. g. exceptio Sc. Macedoniani3 or of the stronger class, barring
both civilis and naturalis obligatio; e. g. exceptio Sc. Velleiaui.

(4) He declared the probibited disposition to be entirely invalid.
Such an ordinance is called ΒΥ Ulpian perfecta lem and is exem-

plified in lex Falcidia.
The second of these paths of prohibition ceased to be trodden

after an interpretative law of Theodosius ΙΙ. A law prohibiting

municipal senators (curiales) from the management (procu-
ratio) of other persons’ estates had been evaded by means of
simulated leases (conductio). In consequence of this, Theodosius
enacted, in substance, that any prohibitive law, even though it
contained no express terms of nullification‚ should be interpreted to
be lex perfecta3 aud that any simulated dispositions, whereby a
