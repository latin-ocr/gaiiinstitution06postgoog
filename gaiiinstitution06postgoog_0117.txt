dence, vested in the husband, 2 ᾧ 98.

Manus was perhaps originally an essential accompaniment of civil
wedlock, and the patriarche of the Roman nation could probably
not conceive of the conjugal union as disjoined from manus. Yet
at a very early period of Roman history these elements of marriage
were recognized as separable, and in later times they were almost
universally dissociated, and wedlock was unaccompanied by manus,
In a marriage celebrated without confarreation and without coemp-
tion, before the expiration of the first year of cohabitation, there
was civil wedlock without manus, and the Twelve Tables provided
a method (trinoctio abesse) by which this state could be indefinitely
prolonged: a filiusfamilias was capable of civil wedlock, but had no
manus, for marital power, like every other civil right, passed out of
the dependent husband to vest in the father3 and as soon as gentile
marriages were recognized by the legislator the Romans were still
more familiarized with the spectacle of lawful matrimony without

independence3 manus was almost obsolcte in the time of Gaius, and ,-

it has quite vanished from the legislation of J ustinian.
confarreation was a form of marriage which made the issue
eligible for certain high sacerdotal functions‚ and may therefore be
regarded as characteristic of the patrician caste. Originally it prob-
ably produced marital power in its full extent 3 but when Augustus,
3.(3. 10, aster a vacancy of seventy-five yearS, renewed the priesthood
of Jove (flaminium diale) he limited by statute the legal effect of
confarreation in that particular instance, ᾧ 136; and Tiberine, Aa).

Henceforth it only operated a change of family in respect of sacred ---

rites (ωσι-πῂ the woman ceased to have the domestic gods and
domestic worship of her father, and took in exchange the domestic
gods and domestic worship of her husband. But in secular matters
her family was unchanged: she remained, if filiafamilias, subject to
patria potestas, and did not become quasi filiafamilias in the house-
hold of her husband: her old ties of agnation in her father’s family
were not snapped, and no new ties of agnation 111 her husband's
family were acquired. Divorce (diffarreatio) was almost impos-
sible, and this indissolubility of the connection contributed to the
·unpopnlarity of confarreatio. Moreover, it was a religious cere-
mmial, requiring the presence of the pontifex maximus and flamen
