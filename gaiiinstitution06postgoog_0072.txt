eorum est qui dediticiorum numero

intra centesimum urbis Romae
miliarium morari prohibentur; et
si contra fecerint, ipsi bonaque
eorum publice venire iubentur ea
condicione, ut ne in urbe Roma

the prevalent opinion.

ξ 26. It is only the lowest grade
of freedom, then, that is enjoyed
by freedmen assimilated to surren-
dered aliens, nor does any statute,
senatusconsult, or constitution open
to them a way of obtaining Roman
citizenship.

ξ 27. Further, they are forbid·
den to reside in Rome or within
the hundredth milestone from Rome ;
and if they disobey the prohibition,
their persons and goods are directed
to be sold on the condition that
they shall be held in servitude be·
yond the hundmdth milestone from
Rome, and shall be incapable of
subsequent manumission, and, if
manumitted, shall be slaves of the
people of Rome. and these pro-

visions are dispositione of the lex
, Aelia Sentia.

ξ 17. Manumission was either a public or a private act. When
manumission, besides freeing a slave from the dominion of his pro-
prietor‚ converted him into a citizen of Rome, it was not a matter
of merely private interest to be accomplished by the sole volition
of the proprietor. Accordingly, the three modes of manumission
which conferred the Roman franchise on the manumitted slave,
testamento, censu, vindicta, involved in different forms the inter-
vention of the State.

Wills were originally executed at the Comitia calata, 2 ᾧ 101,
where the dispositions of the testator, including his donatione of
freedom, received legislative sanction, being converted into a private
law by the ratification of the sovereigu assembly.

of manumission, although the people here at the utmost were
only symbolically represented by the witnesses of a mancipation.

Bequests of liberty were either direct or indirect. A direct bequest ·

of liberty (directo data libertas) made the manumitted slave a freed-
man of the testator (libertus orcinus, I nst. 2, 24, 2); an indirect
bequest, that is, a request to the successor to manumit the slave
(fideicommissaria libertas), made the slave on manumission a freed-
man of the successor, 2 ᾧ 266.
