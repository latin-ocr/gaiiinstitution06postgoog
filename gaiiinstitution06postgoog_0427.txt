The surety or guarantor, after payment of the debt, had formerly
no right to insist that the debt or instrument ΒΥ which the debt
was evidenced should be assigned to him3 for such assignment was
held to be utterly useless, inasmuch as the debt was extinguished‚
and the instrument was worthless as an evidence of debt because
proof of payment would be a conclusive answer to any claim de-
pending thereupon. (The emptio nominis concededto the Roman
surety was not recognized.) Co-guarantors, however, were entitled
in equity to all collateral securities which the guarantee or creditor
might have taken. But ΒΥ a recent enactment every surety who
pays a debt is entitled to stand in the place of the creditor, and to
have all the creditor’s securities assigned to him3 and no action
upon them against the debtor or co·sureties can be barred ΒΥ plea
of payment ΒΥ 1116 surety. In the present state of the law, then,
a surety always has the benefit which the fidejussor might obtain
ΒΥ Emptio nominis.

A surety or guarantor of a debt may require the creditor to pro·
ceed against the principal first, provided he offer to indemnify him
in such proceedings, and to pay any deficiency in the sum which
he may recover. This is called Beneficium excussionis, and was ·
introduced ΒΥ J ustinian, Novella 4.

'Phe most noticeable rule of English law respecting the contract
of guaranty is that it must be in writing. No action shall be
brought whereby to charge the defendant upon any sfflcial promise
to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another person,
unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought, or
some memorandum or note thereos, shall be in writing and signed
ΒΥ 1116 party to Β6 charged therewith, or some other person there-
unto ΒΥ him lawfully authorized, Statute of Fraude, 29 Charles II.

The general name of a stipulation ΒΥ way of security for a debt
is cautiO. If the debtor alone was bound, it was called nuda repro-
missi0. If sureties were also bound, it was called satisdatio or
satisacceptio.

Before quitting the subject of suretyship we must observe a
peculiar feature of Roman law, the incapacity of women to play the
part of guarantors. This was enacted ΒΥ 1116 senatusconsultum
Velleianum passed in the reign of Claudius, ΛΔ). 46: Cujus senatus-
consulti verba haee sunt: Quod Marcus Silanus et Velleius Tutor,
consules, verba fecerunt de obligationibus feminarum quae pro aliis
reae fierent, quid de ea re fieri oporteret, de ea re ita consuluerunt:
