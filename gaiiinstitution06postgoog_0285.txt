virtual devisee, would become the slave of the devisee’s successor,
and acquire for him the succession of the testator. 'I'o guard
against the contingency of the death of the slave in the lifetime
of the testator, several slaves might be instituted by way of sub·

ξ 190. In the corresponding title of the Institutes, J ustinian
mentions that an heir might either be appointed to take the whole
of an inheritance or to share it with other coheirs in any propor-
tions. We may briefiy state the technical terms and rules of inter-
pretation by which different shares were allotted. An inheritance
was commonly regarded as a pound (as) consisting· of twelve ounces
(unciae). 'I'he different fractions were thus denominatedz uncia,
a twelfth of an as, or an ounce3 sextans, a sixth of an as, or two
ouuces ς quadrans, a fourth of an as, or three ounces3 trieuS, a third
of an as, or four ounces3 quincunx, five ounces 3 semis, half an as,
or six ounces3 septunx, seven ounces; bes (bis triens), two thirds
of an as, or eight ounces3 dodrans (deme quadrantem), an as minus
a fourth, or nine ounces ; dextans (deme sextantem), an as minus
a sixth, or ten ounces3 deunx (deme unciam), an as minus an ounce,
or eleven ounces,· as, twelve ounces.

An heir instituted in twelve ounces (ex asse) took the whole: but
it was a rule that no one could be partly testate and partly intes-
tate, and therefore if an heir were instituted in a part (ex parte)
and no other coheir instituted, that part represented a pound‚ and
the heir took the whole. So if the shares allotted to several coheirs
amounted to more than twelve ounces, then, if no other heir was
appointed with an unexpressed share, the as was deemed to consist
of more than twelve ounces, and each coheir took a ratable part of
the inheritance. If one heir were instituted in a part, say ex besse,
and a coheir were instituted sor whom no part was expressed‚ then
the coheir would take the residue of the as, that is, would be
deemed to be instituted ex triente. But if the parts expressed for
certain heirs exhausted or exceeded the as and another heir or heirs
were named without express sbares‚ then the whole inheritance was
supposed to consist of two asses (dupondius) and the expressed
shares were reduced to so many ounces out of twenty-four, the heir
or heirs with unexpressed parts taking the residue. Similarly,
if necessary, the inheritance was supposed to consist' of thirty-six
ounces.

Ifthe institution of one coheir lapsed, the shares of the remaining
