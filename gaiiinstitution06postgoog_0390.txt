368 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [111. ἕξ 90, 91.

of shipwreck, fite, civil commotion‚ the fall of a house, can sue in
penal damages for twice the value of the deposit. Praetor ait:
Quod neque tumultus neque incendii, neque ruinae, neque naufragii
causa depositum sit, in simplum, earum autem rerum quae supra
comprehensae sunt in duplum judicium dabo, Dig. 16, 3, 1. ‘ 'Phe
praetor says in his edict: When neither tumult, fire, the fall of a
house, nor shipwreck is the occasion of a deposit, the simple value,
otherwise, twice the value, of the deposit shall be recoverable by
action! Sequestration is the deposit of a subject of litigation by
consent of parties or order of the court in the hands of a stake-
holder (sequester) to abide the result of the trial. When a de-
positary is bound to restore not a specific thing (idem) but its
equivalent, and by a pactum adjectum pays interest for the pri-
vilege of using it in the interim 3 e. g. when a banker pays interest
to his depositors; the convention is called Depositum irregulare,
and dominion in the thing deposited, as well as possession, passes
to the depositary. Dig. 16, 3, 24.

Pignus, pledge, pawn, or mortgage, is the transfer of a qualified
property (jus in re aliena) in a thing, movable or immovable, to be
held as a security for a debt, and to be retransferred when the debt
is satisfied.

There are three forms of Pignus, corresponding to three eras
in the development of Roman law, which must be separately ⁴
examined.

(1) The earliest form of pledge was effected by a. nexum, ac-
companied with a fiducia, or contract for reconveyance. This
ceremony was employed in the contract of pledging‚ in the con-
tract of deposit, and as we have seen, 1 ξ 132, in the emancipation
of children. Fiduciam vero accepit cuicunque res aliqua mancipatur
‘- ut eam mancipanti remancipet; velut si quis tempus dubium
timens amico potentiori fundum mancipet, ut ei, quum tempus quod
suspectum est praeterierit, reddat: haec mancipatio fiduciaria nomi-
natur idcirco quod restituendi fides interponitur, Boethius ad Cic.
Top. 10, Ml. ‘ Fiducia is a thing mancipated under an agree·
ment for remancipation‚ as when land in a time of danger is con·
veyed to a powerful friend in trust to be reconveyed when the
danger is past. Such mancipation is called fiduciary‚ from the trust
or promise of remancipation? Fiducia est cum res aliqua sumendae
mutuae pecuniae gratia vel mancipatur vel in jure ceditur, Isidor.
