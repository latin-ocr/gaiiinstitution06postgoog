Exceptions are capable of various classifications.

As a Negation of the plaintiff's right forms either what we have
called the first mode of defence or the second, according ae it is
founded on a fact contemporaneous or subsequent to the plaintiff’s
title, so Exceptions rest on facte either contemporaneons or sub-
sequent to those which found the claim· of the-plaintiff. Examplee
of contemporaneous exceptione are exceptio doli, exceptio metus,
averring that a disposition on which the plaintiff relies was
originally vitiated by force or fraud. Examplee of subsequent
exceptione are the exceptione rei judicatae, longi temporis posses-
sionis, pacti conventi de non petendo. In a Negative averment
the subsequent event is ground of avoidance: in an exception the
subsequent event ie ground of counteraction.

Some exceptione can only be employed by a particular defendant
(exceptio personae cohaerens): an example of this is beneficium
competentiae, which cannot be pleaded by a debtor's sureties or
successore. Others, and the great majority, are available to all de-
fendente without distinction (exceptio rei cohaerens).

Some exceptione are only available against a particular plaintiff
(exceptio in personam). E. g. the exceptio doli, Si in ea re nihil
dolo malo actoris factum est, only lies against the person by whose
fraud a disposition was vitiated‚ his donees and universal succcseors3
not against a vendee or singular successor. The majority are
equally available against all the world (exceptio in rem); e. g. the
exceptio met-us, which ie expressed impersonally, Si in ea re nihil
metus causa factum est, and lies against all whose title depende on
the vitiated disposition.

'Phe counteraction of the plaintiff’e right by exceptio has different
degrees of potency.. Some exceptione have the stronger effect and
deprive the plaintiff' 8 right of all efficacy, barring all obligatio both
naturalis and civilis: others have the weaker effect, and though
they deprive the plaintiff'e right of obligatio civilis, leave it invested
with obligatio naturalis. Instances of the weaker effect are the ex-
ceptio Sc. Macedoniani, Dig. 14, 6, 10, and beneficii competentiae,
Dig. 12, 6, 8, 9. Instances of the stronger effect are exceptio Sc.
Velleiani‚ Dig. 12, 6, 40, pr., exceptio doli, Dig. 12, 6, 65, 1, exceptio
metus, Dig. 12, 5, 7, exceptio pacti, Dig. 12, 6, 40, 2. The effect
of the exceptione of res judicata and prescription or lapse of time, as
we have already stated, is controverted: but they both apparently
have the stronger operation, except that in real actions praecription
