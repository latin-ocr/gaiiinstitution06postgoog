as in the interdicto Quorum bonorum, ᾧ 144. But in spite of the
variety of physieal acts which it denotes, the word Restituere is
univocal if we look at its legal connotation, which is always the
undoing of some wrong, the reinstatement of a person in the pos·
session and enjoyment of a right.

Exhibere' 1s the production of a thing or person, and was usually‘

the preliminary of a vindication. Quem liberum hominem dolo malo
retines exhibeas, D1g43, 29, 1. ‘The freeman whom you unlawfully
detain I command you to produce? Qui quaeve in potestate Lucii
Titii est, si is eave apud te est, dolove malo factum est quominus
apud te esset, ita eum eamve exhibeas, Dig. 43, 30, 1. ‘ The son or
daughter of Lucius Titius, who is subject to his power, and whom
you detain or have fraudulently ceased to detain‚ I command you to
produce!

ᾧ 144. The interdict Quorum bonorum, according to flavigny,
was the remedy whereby a successor, whether civil or praetoriam,
and, if praetorian, whether eontra tabulas or seeundum tabulas or
ab intestato, having already, in response to his demand (agnitio)
of the succession, obtained from the praetor the formal grant
(datio) of bonorum possemiO, maintained his title thereto before
the tribunale if he met with opposition3 just as hereditatis petitio
was the remedy whereby the civil successor could have maintained
a corresponding claim to the hereditas.

The terms of the interdict ran as follows: Quorum bonorum ex ·

edicto meo illi possessio data est, quod de his bonis pro herede aut
pro possessore possides, possideresve si nihil usucaptum esset,
quodque dolo malo fecisti ut desineres possidere, id illi restituas,
Dig. 43, 2, 1. ‘ Whatever portion of the goods, granted in pur-
suance of my edict to be possessed by such and such a one, thou
possessest as successor or as unentitled occupant, or wouldest so
possess but for usucapion, or hast fraudulently ceased to possess,
such portion do thou deliver up to such a one!

Quorum bonorum was the proper remedy against two classes of
adversary: (1) any one who claimed as successor (pro herede), either
under the praetorian edict, Dig. 5, 3, 11 pr„ or as cestui qne trust
(fideicommissarius), Dig. 5, 3, 20, 13, οι· at civil law3 and (2)
praedo, or any one who seized and held without title, or merely
by title of occupancy (pro possessore), in virtue of the anomalous
law which permitted strangers to seize vacant hereditaments, and
convert possession into ownership by a short period of usucapion‚
