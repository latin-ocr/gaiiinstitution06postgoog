retained in order to force the testator to have before his mind a
clear and systematis view of his intentione by requiring· their
simultaneous expression in a single document. It secured the
asterborn from oblivion and protected the son who was falsely
supposed to be dead from the consequences of the testator’s error.
At the latest period the use of Codicils permitted to a certain
extent the partial and fragmentary disposition of a patrimony,
but this was not extended to the principal point, the heredum
institutio. Ibering, ξ 53.

sexes, enacting· that the pretermission of any suus heres or sua
heres should absolutely vacate a will, and entitle to bonorum pos-

prevent this, the civil law made an exception to the rule that
an uncertain person cannot be instituted or disinherited, and
permitted the institution or disinheritance of any suus heres who
