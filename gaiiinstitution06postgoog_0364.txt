ξ 77. Missio in possessionem and the subsequent bonorum ven-
ditio correspond in their essential character to the adjudication of
bankruptcy and the concomitant transfer of the debtor’s estate to
the creditor’s trustee of English jurisprudence.

Roman law never established any distinction between traders
and non-tradere, in other werde, between bankruptcy and insolvency,
⁴a distinction once important in English law, and which even at the
present day is not entirely effaced. Formerly, in consideration of
the hazardous nature of trade, and the necessity of large credits to
sustain an extensive commerce, the trader was treated with greater
indulgence than the non-trader3 and bankruptcy operated as a
discharge of obligations, whereas insolvency only discharged the
person of the debtor‚ and left his obligation to pay out of his aster
acquired estate in full force. This distinction is now abolished‚ and
tradere and non-traders are placed on the same footing. Roman
law in respect of the continuing obligation of the bankrupt re·
sembled the English law of insolvency.

In order to form a clear conception of this branch of the laW, it
is necessary to distinguish between an ordinary judgment execution
in a personal action, that is to say, the enforcement by the power
of the state of a judgment debt against a debtor who contumaciously
omits to satisfy the judgment by voluntary payment, from an
adjudication of bankruptcy, which is the process when a debtor is
not only unwilling but also unable to fulfil his obligations. The
English process in an ordinary execution is either a writ of fieri
faciae, commanding the sheriff to satisfy the debt by seizure and
sale of the personal goods of the debtor3 or a writ of levari facias,
now disused, directing him to levy the debt out of the personal
goods of the debtor‚ and the rents and profits of his land ς οι· a writ
of elegit, commanding him to deliver the debtor’s goods to the
creditor at an appraisement, and to put the creditor in possession of
the debtor’s land, to hold until out of the rents and profits thereos
the debt is levied3 or formerly, before imprisonment for debt was
