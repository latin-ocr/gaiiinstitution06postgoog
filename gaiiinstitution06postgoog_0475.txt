the defendant (bilaterally penal)‚ at least to impoverish the de-
fendant without enriching the plaintiff (unilaterally penal), as, for
example, suits for indemnification. Real actions and actions ex
contractu are not Penal but civil, conservative, or Restorative3
they maintaiu the fortunes of both parties at their original level;
at the level destroyed or impeded by the defendant's wrong. We
have before used the term civil to distinguish the Private code
from the Political code and the Criminal code. We here take it
in a narrower sense to distinguish that part of the Private code
which deals with Domestie relations and Dominion and Obligation
ex contractu from that part which deals with Obligation ex delicte,

which latter part may be called the Penal code. Penal juris-
prudence forms a sort of intermediate between civil jurisprudence,
in this narrower sense, and Crimina] jurisprudence.

ξ 183. Fur-torum autem genera
Servius Sulpicius et Masurius Sa-
binus 1111 esse dixerunt, manifestum
et nec manifestum, conceptum, et
oblatum: Labeo duo, manifestum,
nec manifestum; nam conceptum
et oblatum species potius actionis
esse furto cohaerentes quam genera
furtorum quod sane verius videtur,
sicut inferius apparebit.

ξ 184. Manifestum fiio-tum qui-
dam id esse dixerunt quod dum fic
deprehenditur. alii vero ulterius,
quod eo loco deprehenditur ubi fit:
velut si in oliveto olivarum, in vine-
to uvarum furtum factum est, quam-
diu in eo oliveto aut vineto fur
sit 3 aut si in domo furtum factum
sit, quamdiu in ea domo fur sit.
alii adhuc ulterius, eousque mani·
festum furtum esse dixerunt, donec
perferret eo quo perferre fur de·
stinasset. alii adhuc ulterius, quan-
doque eam rem fur tenens visus
fuerit3 quae sententia non optinuit.

ξ 183. Thests are divided by Ser·
vius Sulpicius and Masurius Sabinus
into four kinds, theft detected in
the commission, simple thest, the
possession of stolen goods discovered
upon search, and the introductiou
of stolen goods. Labeo makes only
two kinds, thest. detected in the
commission and simple theft, be-
cause the possession and introduc-
tion of stolen goods are not thefts‚
but actionable circumstances con-
nected with thest3 and this seems
the better opinion, as will presently
appear.

ξ 184. Theft detected ιιι the com-
mission is limited by some to de-
tection in the act of taking3 by
others extended ‘to detection while
the thies is in the place where the
theft is committed; for instance,
if olives are stolen from an olive·
γει-ἀ, οι· grapes from a vineyard,
while the thief 1s in the oliveyard or
vineyard3 or if a theft is com-
mitted in a house, while the thief
is in the house. Others extend it
to detection before the thies has
carried the goods away to the place
where be intends to deposit them;
