628 DE Aonomssus. [ιν. §5 138-170.

2 ξ 52. If the adversary claimed on any other title, e. g.'pro empto
or pro donat0, the proper remedy of bonorum possessor or heres
was not by Quorum bonorum nor by Hereditatis petitio, but by
an ordinary Real action (Rei vindicatio). 'Phe words ‘ possideresve
· si nihil usucaptum foret ' are a trace of the 86. J uventianum,
which relieved the bonorum possessor against usucapion, i. e. which
rescinded the usucapion, and allowed Quorum bonorum to be
brought even after usucapion had been completed and the bona fide
putative successor or the mala fide unentitled occupant no longer
possessed pro herede or pro possessore, but pro suo, 2 ᾧ 57. (Ac-
cording to Puchta, usucapion was always unavailing against
Quorum bonorum, and the effect of 86. J uventianum was only to
assist the heir at civil law, by inserting in the formula of Here-
ditatis petitio a clause that had always as a matter of course been
inserted in the interdict Quorum bonorum.)

According, then, to Savigny, Quorum bonorum was a definitive
suit in matters of succession when the plaintiff, instead of claiming
hereditas in reliance 011 jus civile, claimed bonorum possessio in
'reliance on jus praetorium. But the prevalent opinion is that
of Vangerow, that Quorum bonorum was merely a summary and
provisional procedure for obtaining possession pending the defini-
tive suit for the succession. Such possession was defensible
(sine re) by an adverse decision of the final suit, which, if the
succession was by civil law, would be hereditatis petitio; if it
was merely praetorian‚ as founded on cognatio svo„ hereditatis
petitio possessoria, Dig. 5, 5, 1. In support of this view, it may
be observed that on Savigny’s hypothesis no satisfactory account
can be given of the nature of hereditatis petitio possessoris..

ᾧ 148. In the real actions of statute-process or the eldest system
the procedure for awarding provisional possession during the
pendency of a suit was called Vindiciae dicendae, Gellius 20, 10.
111 the later methods of real action, vindicatio per sponsionem or per
formulam petitoriam, Vindiciae dicendae was apparently superseded
by the interdicts Utrubi and Uti possidetis; which, accordingly,
would bear the same relation to vindicatio that Quorum bonorum
bore to hereditatis petitio.

As these interdicts were required 130 determine the question who
should have possession pending the vindicatiO, so it is clear
that a third anterior proceeding would be necessary to determine
who should have provisional possession during the pendency of
