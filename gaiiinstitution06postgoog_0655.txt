coverable from the commeneement of the suit, by Unde vi from the
time of the ejectment3 and the remedy of the disseisee by Uti
possidetis was barred by the vices of his own possession, not so ‚his
remedy by Unde vi.

As violent dispossession was remedied by the interdict Unde vi,
so other interdicte remedied dispossession whose inception was
clandestine or permissive. An interdict De clandestina possessione
seems to be mentioned, Dig. 10, 3, 7, 5. But it would scareely bc
required in the case of immovablcs, for as a possessor was not -
disseised until he had notice of the invasion, he could immediately
by attempting an entry convert the clandestine into a violent dis-
possession. Nor would it be required for movables, for clandestine
dispossession of a movable might be redressed by Utrubi combined, -
perhaps, with an exhibitory interdict or order o‘f production. Ac-
cordingly, it is generally supposed that no special interdict against
clandestine dispossession ever existed.

'Phe interdict De precario was in these terms3 Quod precario ab
illo habes, aut dolo malo fecisti ut desineres habere, qua de re agitur,
id illi restituas, Dig. 43, 26, 2. ‘The possession of the thing in
question which thou holdest by the permission of such a one, or
hast fraudulently ceased to hold, do thou restore to hjm?

Before we quit this topic we may take the opportunity of con-
sidering some of the respects in which the disposition called Pre-

carium differed from a closely allied institution, the conti-act called ἲ

commodatum.
(1) Precario rogans (the precarious tenant) generally had pos-

session: commodatarius (the borrower) never had more than de- .

telltgnlllbe obligation in Precarium is purely unilateral and on the
side of precario rogans. Precario dans (the grantor of precarious

tenancy) is under no obligation, not even the semi-bilateral obli-

gation for impensae &c., which is incumbent on Commodans (the
lender).

(3) Precario rogans is not, like commodatarius, responsible for
diligentia, Dig. 43, 26, 8, 3.

At a late period of Roman law Precarium was so far regarded as
a contractual obligation that Precario dans could recover by an
actio praescriptis verbis, Dig. 43, 26, 2, 2, and 19, 2. Thus Pre-
cario dans had two remedies‚ an action on delict (interdictum de
precario), for' such, we shall see, was the nature of tbe possessory ’
