358 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [111. ἐξ 88, 89.

moneyz Factio any service (traditio, restitutio, exhibitio, διο.) other
than the transfer of quiritary dominion in a certain thing: and
Praestatio, apparently, the discharge of any obligation engendered
by maleficium.

However diversified may be‘ the Object of an obligation, it is
always transformable, in the eye of the law, into the payment of a
certain sum of money. Ea enim in obligatione consistere quae
pecunia lui praestarique possunt, Dig. 40, 7, 9, 2. ‘ Obligation
can only have for its Object something redeemable and replaceablc
by money.' Hence if it is desired to bind to the performance of
some act not in its nature susceptible of pecuniary appreciation, it
is necessary to make the direct Objeet of stipulation the payment of
a certain penal sum, and the non-performance of the act desired
the title or condition whereupon the penal sum shall be forfeited3
for then the obligation, having a pecuniary value, is a civil obliga-
tion enforceable by the tribunals. 'I'he performance of the act
desired is thus practically enforced‚ although nominally it is
removed from the position of Object of the stipulation to that of
condition. .

In speaking of the right of Dominion, we have already noticed
(2 ᾗ l, commentary) that besides the primary omnm* of the right
(abstention from molestation), there is always a secundary object or
summ, land, house, slave, or the like, to which such molestation
relates. So, in view of this transformability of all Objects of
obligation into money paymentS, we may say that the osmer of
every obligation is an Alienation, or transfer of property3 and the
sumam* is always a certain amount of Pecuniary value.

The primary and most comprehensive division of Obligatio is one
that has already been noticed, 1 ᾖ l, into (A) elvlus obligatio, and
(B) nunnus obligatio,

(A) Omns obligatio is obligation enforceable by action, whether
it derives its origin from J us civile, as the obligation eng-endered
by formal contracta or the obligation enforceable by bilaterally
penal suite, or from such portion of J us gentium as had been com-
pletely naturalized in the civil law and protected by all its remedies3
such as the obligation engendered by Formless contracts, and
obligation to indemnify engendered by delict. *

(B) Obligatio NATURALIS is obligation not immediately enforce-
able by action, or obligation imposed by that portion of J us
gentium which is only imperfectly recognised by Civil law3 obliga-
