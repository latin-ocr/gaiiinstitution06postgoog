testator who had none in his possession 61 1116 11166 of his death,
the heir would be bound to procure and convey it or its value to
the legatee, but there would be no specific thing in existence which
the legatee could 16611161 by real 661106.

ᾗ 207. Τ116 1066 of the legacies which they otherwise would have
acquired under the 161 Ρ61116, was one of the penalties whereby the
legislator endeavoured to deter successore and legatees from under-
taking secret trusts (fideicommissum tacitum) contrived for the
purpose of evading some disqualification. In fraudem juris fidem
accommodat, qui vel id quod relinquitur vel aliud tacite promittit
restituturum se personae. quae legibus 61 testamento capere pro·
hibetur, 6116 chirographum eo nomine dederit, sive nuda polli-
citatione repromiserit, D. 34, 9, 10 (from a treatise of Gaius on the
lex J ulia 61 Ρ61116. ‘ A devisee lends his honour 10 1116 6166106 of
the law when, without 6 1111661106 06 1116 face of the will, he 66-
gages to transfer 6 1161166 01 other property to some pers'on legally
disqualified for taking under 6 will, whether the engagement be by
formal written contract or by naked verbal promise! In England
secret trusts led to the passing of the statute of Uses and Trusts.
At Rome secret trusts (on which Gaius wrote 6 11661166, D. 34, 9,
23) were discouraged by being made one of the cases of Ereption
for unworthiness, ᾗ 151. 81 quis in fraudem tacitam fidem 'ac-
commodaverit, ut non capienti fideicommissum restituat, nec
quadrantem eum deducere senatus censuit, nec caducum vindicare
ex eo testamento si liberos habeat, Ulpian, 25, 1⁷. ‘ An heir who
lends his assistance to the evasion of the law by the acceptance of
6 666161 111161 16 favour of 6 disqualified beneficiary loses by decree
of the senate his right under the 161 Falcidia to retain one fourth
of his iuheritance, and to claim the escheated leg-acies, to which
by the 161 Ρ61116 116 would have been entitled as a father of
children.'
