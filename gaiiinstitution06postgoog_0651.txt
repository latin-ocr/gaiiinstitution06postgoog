litigation on the interdict: and similarly we might imagine a
fourth, a. fifth, and in fact an infinite series of anterior proceedings
to be required. We shall find however that this regressus ad
infinitum was stopped at the third term by means of an auction
(fructus licitatio), ᾧ 166, a process of a very summary character.
If a party attempted to defeat this provision by refusing to take
partin the auction, his opponent was aided by interdicta Secundaria‚
ᾧ 170. It may seem that opposition to the issue of interdicta
Secundaria would again open out a vista of an infinite series of
anterior steps3 but, doubtlesS, the only means of preventing the
issue of interdictum Secundarium was an instant consent to co-
operation in fructus licitati0.

Fructus licitatio was obsolete in the time of J ustinian: in modern
Italy and Germany it is superseded by a process called Summariis-
simum3 in which the judge on a brief inquisition provisionally
awards possession to the party who proves the last act of undis-
turbed possession.

The inter-dict Uti possidetis was of the following form: Uti eas ‘

aedes, quibus de agitur, nec vi nec clam nec precario alter ab altero
possidetis, quominus ita possideatis, vim fieri veto. De cloacis hoe
interdictum non dabo: neque pluris quam quanti res erit, intra
annum quo primum experiundi potestas fuerit, agere permittam,
Dig· 4, 32 17, l· ‘ Whichever party has possession of the house
in question, without violence, clandestinity, or permission in respect
of the adversar-y, the violent disturbance of his possession I pro-
hibit. Sewers are not included in this interdict. The value of the
thing in dispute and no more may be recovered within the first
year of days available for procedure (annus utilis, p. 255).‘ A form
nearly identical is preserved in Festus: Uti nunc possidetis eum
fundum quo de agitur, quod nec vi nec clam nec precario alter
ab altero possidetis, quominus ita possideatis vim fieri veto, The
right of the possessor was not affected if his possession was com-
menced by violence, clandestinity, or permission in respect of any
other person than the defendant. Nam uti possidetis interdicto
is vincebat qui interdicti tempore possidebat, si modo nec vi
nec clam nec precario nactus fuerat ab adversario possessionem,
etiamsi alium vi expulerat, aut clam abripuerat alienam posses-
sionem, aut precario rogaverat aliquem ut sibi possidere liceret,
