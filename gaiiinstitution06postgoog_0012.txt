vi PREFAOE.

tum, occurs in 2 ἦ 195, and looks like an annotation transferred by
a transcriber from the margin to the text. As this use of the word
is very barbarous and comparatively recent, Huschke is inclined to
believe that the century preceding J ustinian is the earliest date that
can be assigned to the MS.

In a year after Niebuhr's discovery the whole text of Gaius had
been copied out by Goeschen and Hollweg, who had been sent to
Verona for that purpose by the Prussian Royal Academy of Sciences,
and in 1820 the first edition was published. Since that time the
text has been gradually purified by the labours—the wonderful
learning, ingenuity, and patience—of many distinguished German
jurists and scholars.

Little is known about Gaius, not even his family name (cog-
nomen), or gentile name (nomen), for Gaius is merely an individual
name (praenomen). The word ‘ Gaius ’ is a trisyllable in the
classical period, for instance, in the versification of Catullus,
Martial, and Statius3 but at a later period, e. g. in the versification

· of Ausonius, it is contracted into a dissyllable.

Respecting his date, we know that he flourished under the
emperors Hadrian (Aa). 117-138), Antoninus Pius (Am. 188-161),
Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (Aa). 161-180), and Commodus (Aa).
180-192). Gaius himself mentions that he was a contemporary of
Hadrian, Dig. 34, 5, 7, pr. He apparently wrote the First Book
of his institutione under Antoninus Pius, whom he mentione, ξ 53,
ᾧ 74, ἦ 102, without the epithet Divus (of divine or venerable
memory)‚ a term only applied to emperors after their decease, but
in the Second Book, ᾗ 195, with this epithet. The Antoninus men·
tioned, ἦ 126, is either Pius or Marcus Aurelius Philosophus.
Respeeting the rules of Creti0‚ 2 ᾧ 177, Gaius appears not to be
cognizant of a constitution of Marcus Aurelius mentioned by
Ulpian, 22, 34. That he survived to the time of Commodus ap·
pears from his having written a treatise on the Sc. Orphitianum, an
enactment passed under that emperor.

As the opinions of Gaius are not quoted by the subsequent
jurists whose fragments are preserved in the Digest, it has been
inferred that Gaius was a public teacher of jurisprudence (jus
publice docens), who never in his lifetime obtained the highest
distinction of the legal profession, the title of juris auctor (jus
publice respondens). Valentinian, however, after his death raised
Gaius to the position of juris auctor, that is, gave to his writings
