Q. M. OBLIGATIO TOLLATUR.

soon as the priucipal was allowed to sue on the contracte of the
agent without the agent’s consent or transfer of his right of action.

QUIBUS MODls OBLIGATIO TOLLATUR.

§168. Tollitur autem obligatio
praecipue solutione eius quod de-
beatur. unde quaeritur, si quis con-
sentiente creditore aliud pro alio
solverit. utrum ipso inre liberetur,
quod nostris praeceptoribus placet:
an ipso iure maneat obligatuS, secl
adversus petentem exceptione doli
mali defendi debeat, quod diversae
scholae auctoribus visum est.

§ 169. Item per acceptilationem
tollitur obligatio. acceptilatio autem
est veluti imaginaria soluti0. quod
enim ex verborum obligatione tibi
debeam, id si velis mihi remittere,
poterit sic fieri, ut patiaris haec
verba me dicere: QUOD EGO ΤΙΒΙ
Pnomsl, naussum acernum et
tu respondeas: HABEO.

ξ 170. Quo genere, ut diximus,
tantum hae obliyationes solvuntur
quae ex verbis consistunt, non etiam
ceterae: consentaneum enim visum
est verbis factam obligationem posse
aliis verbis dissolvi. sed et id quod
ex alia causa debeatur potest in sti-
pulationem deduci et per acceptila-
tionem imaginaria solutione dis-
solvi.

§ 171. Tamen mulier sine tutoris
auctore acceptum facere non potest 5
cum alioquin solvi ei sine tutoris
auctoritate possit.

ξ 168. Extinction osan obligation
is effected chiefly by performance of
the thing that is owed. It is dis-
puted, when the creditor consents to
the substitution of a different per-
formance, whether there is a dis-
charge of the original obligation, as
my school consider, or there is a
continuance of the original obliga-
tion‚ though against a demand 8
counteractive defence (an averment
of an independent counter obliga-
tion) may be luade by the excep-
tion of fraud, as the other school
maintain.

§ 169. Acceptilation is another
mode of extinguishing an obliga-
tiou. Acceptilation is an imaginary
payment by a solemn form of
words. If a creditor is willing to
release a debt created by verbal
contract, the object may be accom-
plished by the debtor interrogating
him in these terms : ⁴ That which Ι
promised thee hast thou received ‘5'
and the creditor answering: ‘I
have received it.'

ξ 170. This process, as I said,
only discharges obligations that
arise from vei-bal contract, and
no others; for logie seems to dic-
tate that where words can bind,
words may also loose. However,
a debt due from any other cause
may be transformed into a debt
on stipulation, and released by
an imaginat-y verbal payment or
acceptilation.

§171. Observa, that a woman
without her guardian's authority
cannot release by acceptilation, al·
though her receipt of actual pay-
ment without her guardian’s autho-
rity discharges the debtor.
