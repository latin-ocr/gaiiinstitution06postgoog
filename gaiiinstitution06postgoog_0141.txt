Having examined those inferiorities of legal capacity which con-
stituted a status, we now proceed to examine certain cases of inea-
pacity which, though analogous to the former as belonging to the
sphere of unequal rights, were not included ΒΥ the Romans under
the denomination of status. The inferiorities of capacity ininfancy‚
minority, wardship, curatel, were not so considerable as those which
we have hitherto examined. The diminution of rights in a lapse
from independence to curatel was less than the least capitis minuti0‚
and accordingly a prodigal who was interdicted from the administra-
tion of his estate and subjected to the control of a curator, was not
said to undergo a status mutatio: his patrimony still vested in him,
though he was deprived of its administration5 whereas adrogatio
and in manum conventio divested a person of the capacity of
ownership and active obligation: inferior status, in a word, is
incapacity of right 3 wardship and curatel are only incapacities of
disposition.

Guardianship is thus defined ε’ Est autem tutela jus ac potestas in
capite libero, ad tuendum eum qui propter aetatem se defendere
nequit, jure civili data ac permissa, Inst. 1, 13, 1. ‘ Guardianship
is a right and power over an independent person conferred or
authorized ΒΥ the civil law for· the protection of one who is in-
capacitated ΒΥ age for aelf-defence.' The duties of the guardian
related both to the person and to the property of the ward. In
respect of his person, the guardian was charged with the care of
his nurture and education. in respect of his property, the guardian' s
function was distinguished as either exclusive administration or
concurrent interposition of authority. Up to the age of seven the
ward was called infans, and during this period the guardian acted
alone (administratio, negotiorum gestio); after the completion of
seven years until the age of puberty (fourteen for males, twelve for
females) the ward acted, and the guardian concurrently gave his
