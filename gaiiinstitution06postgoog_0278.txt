256 DE RERUM UNIVERSITATIBUS. [11. ἐξ 152—173.

of writings at the office of a court irrespectively of its session days
and vacatione, this cause has lost its importance.

Knowledge (scientia) of the fact that he is entitled is not neces-
sarily requisito on the part of the person entitled: in other words
his ignorance is not always sufficient to exclude a day from the
number of dies utiles. The prescription of an action, when it is
accomplished in annus utilis, begins to run from its nativity (actio
nata), irrespectively of the plaintiff‘s knowledge of his right to sue.
Ignorance of a right of action is generally the effect of Negligence,
and therefore undeserving of relief, and might be protracted for
an indefinite period. On the contrary, ignorance is sometimes ²
a condition that delays the commencement of tempus continuum:
for instance, the 50 dies continui allowed to a person for stating
the grounds on which he was entitled to be excused from accepting
a guardianship only began to run when he had notice of his nomi-
nation, Inst. 1, 25, 16: which shows that scientia and ignorantia
have no necessary relation to the distinction of dies utiles and dies
continui.

In the demand (agnitio) of possession, however, by the claimant
of a testate or intestate successim, the edict expressly made the
scientia as well as the potestas of the claimant a condition of dies
utilis, D. 38, 15, 2. Indeed the aditio of an inheritance, was not
valid unless made with a knowledge of the fact of the delatio and
of its nature, whether testacy or intestacy. Moreover the igno-
rance of his rights could not be ascribed to the negligence of
the person entitled, nor was it likely to be indefinitely protracted,
as it would be the interest of the person next entitled to give him
notice of the delation. Knowledge will generally only affect the
beginning of a term, and the person who is once made aware of the
delation of an inheritance will usually continue aware: but it is
possible that a period of error should supervene; for instance, that,
after an agnato has notice that he is entitled by intestacy and after
his term for acceptance has commenced to run, a forged will should
be produced and obtain credit ε in which case the dies utiles would
not continue to run until the forgery of the will was ascertained.
Savigny, § 189.

The testamentary clause allowing a term for Cretio vulgaris, like
the edict relating to bonorum possessio, made scientia as well as
potestas a condition of temporis utilitas.
