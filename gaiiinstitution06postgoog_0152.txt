130 DE PERSONIS. [1. ξς 159-164.

autem Vestalis simul est capta atque in atrium Vestae deducta et
pontificibus tradita, eo statim tempore sine emancipatione ac sine
capitis minutione e patris potestate exit et jus testamenti faciendi
adipiscitur . . . . Praeterea in commentariis Labeonis quae ad
duodecim tabulas composuit ita scriptum est: Virgo Vestalis neque
heres est cuiquam intestatO, neque intestatae quisquam, sed bona
ejus in publicum redigi aiunt, Gellius, 1, 12. ‘ As soon as a vestal
virgin is selected and conducted to the shrine of Vesta and de-
livered to the pontificeS, she instantaneously, without emancipation
and without capital diminution, is freed from parental power and
acquires testamentary capacity ..... Moreover, in the com-
mentary of Labeo on the Twelve Tables it is stated that a vestal
virgin is neither heiress-at-law to any one who dies intestate nor, if
she herself die intestate‚ leaves any heir-afflaw, and that in this
event her property lapses to the state.’ For Flamen Dialis, see
3 ᾗ 114. If mere transit from a family and ceasing to belong to a
given group of agnates constituted capitis minutiO‚ and was its
definition‚ then the vestal virgin must inevitably have suffered
capitis minuti03 the fact that she did not, in spite of leaving 'her
family and snapping the agnatio tie, is at once conceivable‚ on the
supposition that there is no capitis minutio without degradation.

Unless capitis minutio· minima involved a downward step on the
stair of status, it has no analogy to the other forms of capitis
minutio, and it is not obvious why it should have the same generic
ὃ appellation, or why it should be handled in the same department of
³ the code. The rupture of the ties of agnation, extinguishing rights ·
“ of intestate successim, might be a loss, but it was not a loss from
'‘inferiorit’y of privilege3 it was a loss of an equal among equals3 it
resembled the loss which a husband incurred by, divorce of his wife,
or a father by emancipation of his son, or a devisee or heir by
neglecting to accept a succession within the appointed period,
2 ᾧ 1643 none of which persons were said to undergo capitis
minutio, because none of them suffered a reduction of the univer-
sitas juris called statue.

On the whole, then, Savigny seems justified in considering the
definition given by Paulus and his statement respecting the children
of adrogatus as inexact. Paulus himself, in speaking of emancipa-
tion, implies the true conditione of capitis minutio: Emancipato
filio et ceteris personis capitis minutio manifeste accidit, quum
emancipari nemo possit nisi in imaginariam servilem causam de-
