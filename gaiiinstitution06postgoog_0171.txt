1. §§ 197-200.] DE CURAToRIBUs. 149

It made a criminal offence, and subject to a criminal prosecu-
tion (judicium publicum, Cic. De Nat. Deor. 3, 30), what Cicero
calls circumscriptio adolescentium, De Off. 3, 153 i. e. over-
reaching and circumventing persons below the age of 25. Such
is Savigny's interpretation of judicium publicum, Vermischte
Schriften, 18. Ihering maintains that judicium publicum de-
notes in this passage not a criminal prosecution but an actio
popularis3 i. e. a civil action that could be instituted not only by
the Minor but by a common Informer: and he quotes D. 26, 10, l, 6:
Consequens est ut videamus qui possint suspectos (tutores) postulare,
et sciendum est quasi publicam esse hanc actionem, hoc est, omni-
bus patere, and D. 12, 2, 30, 3, where publica actio means actio
popularis, Geist des Romischen Rechts, ᾧ 52. The circumscrip-
tion of a minor, like maladministration by a guardian, rendered the
person convicted thereos infamis, The statute provided, apparently,
that a contractor with a minor might secure himself against the
penalties of the law, if a curator were nominated by the praetor to
advise the minor in respect of the special transaction.

(2) As the lex Plaetoria was only applicable in cases of fraud
(dolus maluS, Cic. De Off. 3, 15), the protection it gave to minors
was inadequate: accordingly, the praetor proclaimed in his edict
that he would relieve minors who had been damaged in consequence
of inexperience and improvidence by rescission and cancellation of
the proceeding (in integrum restitutio). To obtain this relies it
was not necessary to prove any fraud on the part of the person
who contr-acted with the minor.

(3) A person who wished to bring an action against a minor
could compel him to obtain from the praetor a curator for the
purpose of defending the particular suit3 whose office ceased as
soon as the special litigation terminated. Marcus Aurelius, under
whom Gaius flourished, enacted that any minor who chose should
be able to obtain from the praetor a general curator (generalis
curator), who then should be charged with the general admini-
stration (generalis administratio) of his estate, Capitolinus, 10.
In view oi this option of the minor, J ustinian could still say:
Inviti adolescentes curatores non accipiunt praeterquam ad litem,
Inst. 1, 23, 2. ‘ Unless they choose, minors need not have a curator,
except for a suit.’ A minor who had a curator could not aliene
without the consent of his curator: he could incur an obligation
without the consent of his curator, subject to his right of in
