provisions of the lex Aelia Sentia.
Se, too, a Roman citizen, who
marries an alien, believing himself
to be an alien, is permitted by the
senatusconsult on the birth of a son
to prove the cause of the mistake,
and then the alien wife becomes a
Roman citizen, and the son becomes
a Roman citizen and subject to the
power of the father.

ξ 72. Whatever has been said of
a son applies to a daughter.

ξ 73. And as to the proof of the
cause of error, the age of the son or
daughter is immaterial, except that,
if the marriage was contracted with
an intention to satisfy the require-
ments of the lex Aelia Sentia, the
child must be a year old before the
cause can be proved. I am aware
that a rescript of the late Emperor
Hadrian speaks as if proof of the
cause of error . . . .

ξ 74. When an alien, believed to
be a Roman citizen, married a
Roman wife, and subsequently to
the birth of a son acquired the
Roman franchise, the question aris-
ing whether he could prove the
cause of error, a rescript of An-
toninus Pius decided that he was
just as competent to prove as if
he had continued an alien: from
which may be gathered that an alien
is competent to prove the cause of
error.

§7 5. It appears that an alien
cannot acquire the Roman franchise
under the lex Aelia Sentia, but may
by proof of having contracted a
marriage under a justifiable error.

Mistake or error sometimes conferred a right which a party
‘could not have acquired if he had not acted under a mistake. Thus,
the lender of money to a filiusfamilias without the father's consent
