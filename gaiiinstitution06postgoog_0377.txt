m. ἕξ 85-87.] HEREDITATIS IN JURE GESSIO. 355

ter-est, utrum aliquis cernendo aut other heirs surrender after aceept-

pro herede gerendo heres fiat, an anee, and that it makes no difference

iuris necessitate hereditati adstrin- whether a man is heir ΒΥ legal com-

gatur. [lin. vacum] pulsion or ΒΥ voluntary acceptance
or ΒΥ acts of heirship.

ᾧ 85. Gaius now proceeds to another mode of conveying a juris
universitas, the couveyance ΒΥ an agnate of a delated but not
accepted inheritance. We must bear in mind the distinction
between heres and vocatus ad hereditatem, the offer (delatio) of
an inheritance by the law or by a testator, and its final acquisition
(aditio, acquisitio) ΒΥ the delatee (2 § 152). In the case of the
heres necessarius, the sslf-successor and the testator's manumitted
slave, delatio and acquisitio coincide3 but in the case of the volun-
tarius heres, the agnate or the extraneus scriptae, they are two
distinct events. An explanation of the causes of the different
effecte of au in jure cessio by these different classes might have

thrown some light on this branch of early Roman law, but the rea-
sons are not given ΒΥ Gaius, and perhaps we must now be content
to regard these distinctions as merely positive and inexplicable rules.
Perhaps, as Ihering suggests, it was held, that to permit a devisee to
part with the inheritance —in other words, to convert it into money—-
would have been in direct opposition to the testator’s intention;
who, if he approved of such a step, might have adopted the mode
of testation explained on 2 ᾗ 185, i. e. might have instituted not
the devisee but his slave.

Successio per universitatem, as already mentioned, was an in·
stitution only recognized ΒΥ the legislator in a limited number of
cases: one individual could not make another, in pursuance of
private convention, his universal successor. In respect of the
voluntary transfer, inter vivos, of an inheritance, universal suc·
cession was only admitoed in two cases: transfer ΒΥ an agnate of
delata hereditas (of his right to acquire an intestato succession)
in the interval between delatio and aditio, and transfer (restitutio)
ΒΥ a devioee of a fideicommissaria hereditas in pursuance of a
testamentary trust.

The usual conveyance of an inheritance was not by in jure cessio,
but ΒΥ emptio venditio accompanied with tradition and stipulatione
respecting the debts to or from the inheritance, 2 ξ 252.
