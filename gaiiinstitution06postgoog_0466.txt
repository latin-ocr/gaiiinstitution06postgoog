creditor the debt in the presence of the people, and, after the
balance and bar of bronze had completed the discharge, delivers the
debtor, who called on gods and me‘n to reward his liberator?

As there are five modes of contracting an obligation‚ nexu,
verbis, literis, re, consensu, there are as many corresponding modes
of exoneration. Three of these, re, verbis, nexu, have been men-
tioned. Gaius says nothing of exoneration literis, but it is clear
that as a debt could be constituted by expensilatiO, so it could be
cancelled by a corresponding accepti relatio·

A consensual contract, not yet followed by partial execution (re
nondum secuta, Inst. 3, 29, 4), could be dissolved bya contrary con-
vention. Hae obligationes quae consensu contrahuntur contraria
voluntate dissolvuntur, ibid. ³ Obligations which consent createS,
a contrary accord dissolves) After a part performance, for instance,
a conveyance of the consideration by one of the partieS, the contract
was not abandoned until the other party had made restitution,
Cod. 4, 45, l.

Not only could the obligation created by consensual contract be
extinguished by consent, but obligation created by delict could by
certain statutes be obliterated by convention. Legitima con-
ventio est quae lege aliqua confirmatur, et ideo interdum ex
paeto actio nascitur vel tollitur quotiens lege vel senatusconsulto
adjuvatur, Dig. 47, 10, 6. ‘A convention is statutory which de-
rives validity from some statute, and grounds or destroys a right of
action.’ Thus the obligation and action arising out of outrage (in-
juriarum) and theft could be extinguished by pact, in the latter
case, ΒΥ enactment of the Twelve Tables.

held to operate a novation, but a contract might be valid by J us
gentium though invalid at Civil law3 and in respect of Novation
naturalis obligatio was placed on a level with civilis obligatio.
Novatio est prioris debiti in aliam obligationem, vel civilem vel
naturalem, tranfusio atque translatio, hoc est cum ex praecedente
causa ita nova constituitur ut prior perimatur. . . . Qualiscunque
igitur obligatio est quae praecessit, novari verbis potest, dummodo
sequens obligatio aut civiliter teneat aut naturaliter, ut puta si pu·-
pillns sine tutoris auctoritate promiserit, Dig. 46, 2, 1. ‘ Novation
is the replacement and commutation of a prior debt by a subsequent
obligation, civil or natural 3 or the destruction of a prior title by
the constitution of a second. Every kind of obligation can undergo
