1v.§§ 110-113.] ΝΑΤΠΙΤῩ OF A RIGH'P OF ACTION. 583

It appears then that dominans lost not only his right of action 1
but his servitude (jus) itself by longi temporis consuetudo: and .
that, properly speaking, Prescription‚ or Limitation of right of
action, as opposed to Usucapio, has no existence in the sphere of
Servitude.(1 have not been able to find any writer who exa-
mines this question.)

In every prescription, whether of longer or shorter duration,
two points have to be fixed: the moment at which prescription
begins and the moment at which it is terminated. Ι proceed to ·
the consideration of this problem. ⁸

The date of the Nativity of a right of action (actio nata), or the {1 , ἕ

moment from which prescription begins to run, is in Real actions
the moment when a Real right isviolated3 e. g. the moment when
the defendant takes unpermitted possession of a thing of which
the plaintiff· is proprietor3 or when a hirer or borrower converts ⁴
detention into possession by beginning to possess in his own name
and ιιο13 ιιι the name of the proprietor.

In Personal action on delict prescription begins to run from the

moment of the delict3 for at this moment the sanctioning right
of the plaintiff to recover the penalty 1s complete.

Similarly ιιι Quasi- contracts: prescription of tutelae actio begins χ
136 run' from the end of the guardianship: that of condictio indebiti ξ
from the date of the mistaken ί,,Ρει,)ἰιι6ιι13.

In actions on Contract, according to most writers including
- Savigny, prescriptiou similarly begins to run from the moment at
which the contract is violated, i. e. from the inception of the cre-
ditor’s sanctioning right. According to Vangerow, the running
of prescription does not always wait for the violation of the cre-
ditor's primary right, or a breach of the contract by the debtor.

If a term for performance is fixed‚ then indeed prescription will
begin to run from the expiration of the term, i. 6. from the violation

of the plaintiff's primary right, Cod. 7, 39, ⁹7, 4: but wheneyer >no ’
termjsuprefixed, prescription begine, not, as Savigny holds, from
the creditor's demand of performance but, erQAE'ohe completion of ·’
the contract 3 i. e. contemporaneously with the origin of the primary .
right. It precedes any violation of the plaintiff's right, unless we
assume (what is absurd) that the default of instantaneous perform-
auce is such a violation.

Savigny would except from the rule those contracts which, like
mutuum, depositum, commodatum, precarium, essentially and in
