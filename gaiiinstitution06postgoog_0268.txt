246 DE RERUM UNIVERSITATIBUS. [11. §§ 147—151.

the devolution of his property follows different rules according
as it is real or personal. By feudal law, if a vassal holding a'
transmissible feud died without heirs‚ his feud escheated or re-
verted to the lord. So in England if a tenant in fee die
without leaving lawful heim, for instance, if he leaves no re-
lations but aliens (who are incapable of holding land), his land
escheats to the lord of the fee. But the personal property of a
man who dies intestate and without kindred‚ goes to the crown,
subject always to the widow’s right to a moiety in case she
survive.

§ 151. This paragraph is due to Krueger, and is founded upon
the apograph or facsimile edition of Gaius, recently published by
Studemund, as the fruits of a new examination of the Veronese
manuscript.

Gaius here states that as a grant of bonorum possessio might
be rendered ineffective (sine re) in consequence of the superior
claims of another person by whom the possessor may be evieted, so
the recovery of the civil inheritance by hereditatis petitio might be
rendered unavailing by ablation or ereption for Indignitas.

Ereption for indignitas, an institution which survived in the
legislation of J ustinian, D. 34, 9, C. 6, 35, was a case of want of

heir and legatee, others peculiar to the heir, others peculiar to the
legatee. The forfeiture of the inheritance or legaey was sometimes
in favour of the FiscuS, sometimes in favour of other pei-som,
usually of those who would have taken but for the disposition in
favour of indignus. ’

Iusta-noes of grounds for which either heir or legates forfeited
their interest to the Fiscus were: a secret unlawful trust, coercion of
the testator in respect of his will, neglect to avenge the death of the
testator, a suit denying the status of the testator, impeaehment of
the will for inofficiositaS‚ demand of contra-tabulam possession, 820.

Grounds for which their shares were forfeited to other persons
than the Fiscus were: refusal of the office of guardian when the
prospect of the discharge of this duty was the motive of the
testator’s bounty, refusal to undertake the education of an infant
child of the testator, neglect of the testator's burial, 810.

Grounds on which the heir alone forfeited the whole or part of .
his inheritance to the Fiscus were: concealment of a portion of the
