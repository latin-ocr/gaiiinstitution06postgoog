92 DE PERSONIS. [ῐ. los-1151».

Besides the two modes of originating patria potestas which we
have hitherto examined, birth in civil wedlock and adoption, subse-
quently to the time of Gaius a third mode was introduced, called
by modern jurists Legitimation. This was the promotion of natu-
rales liberi, children born in concubinatus, or cohabitation without
matrimony‚ to the position of justi liberi, children born in lawful
wedlock‚ which, after the extension of the franchise by Caracalla,
would mean the same as children born in civil wedlock. Concu-
binatus was a relation partially recognized by the law, and children
born in concubinage, though they had no right, by title of cog-
nation, ‘to the succession of their father, were recognized as cognatos
of their mother, and differed from children born in promiscuous
intercourse (stuprum), inasmuch as their father was not considered
incertus. There were three modes of the legitimation of natural
children, subsequent marriage, destination to the municipal senate
(curiae oblatio), and imperial rescript. Legitimation by Subsequent
marriage was introduced by Constantine, Aa). 335. Legitimatiou
by· destination to the senate was introduced by Theodosius and
Valentinian, Aa). 443, with the design of replenishing the order of
municipal senators (curiales, decuriones), much reduced in the time
of the later emperors in consequence of the general disinclination
to belong to a class, subject, along with various apparent privileges,
to many onerous and intolerable obligations. To fill the gaps in
this order, a father was permitted to legitimate his natural child by
making him a senator of his municipality (civitas), and was relieved
from the restrictious limiting the amount devisable by testatore to
natural children, cod. 5, 27, 3. Legitimation by imperial rescript
was introduced by J ustinian.

'Phe laws recognizing concubinatus were abrogated by Leo Philo-
sophus, Λα). 887. It was in answer to a proposition of the bishops
to introduce legitimation by subsequeut wedlock that the English
Lords at the Parliament of Merton used the celebrated expression:
Nolumus leges Angliae mutari, 20 Heu. 3, c. 9, Aa). 1236.
