404 DE OBLIGA'HONIBUS. [111. §§ llo-12⁷.

jussores 118118118, ab uno ex fidejussoribus accepta pecunia, praestat
actiones, poterit quidem dici nullas jam esse, quum suum perceperit
et perceptione omnes liberati sint3 sed non ita est3 non enim in
solutum accepit, sed quodammodo nomen debitoris vendidit, et ideo
habet 8811101188, quia tenetur ad id ipsum ut praestet actiones, Dig.
46, 1, 36. ‘ When a creditor secured by guarantors receives the
whole sum from one and cedes him 1118 rights of action, it may be
argued that the rights are extinguished because the claim of the
creditor is satisfied and the satisfaction discharges the debtor and
co-guarantors: but it is not so; for it is not in satisfaction but in
purchase of the debt that the payment is made, and therefore the
creditor retains the right of action and is bound to let the pur-
8118881 sue in his name.’ This passage of Paulus 1188 doubtless been
altered to make it harmonize with the legislation of J ustinian: for
in the time of Paulus not only satisfaction of the debt (Solutio)
but institution of a suit (litis contestatio) extinguished the creditor's
right of action and enabled the fidejussors to defend themselves by
the Exceptio rei in judicium deductae.

This power of litis contestatio to extinguish the creditor’s right
of action when there was a relation of Correality between a number
of debtors was doubtless a powerful motive towards substituting
for Fidejussio other forms of guaranty involving Solidarity instead
of Correality, and consequently f1ee from process-consumption or
extinction of right of action by mere litis contestatio. Such forms
were Mandatum qualificatum and Constitutum debiti alieni. At
a later period process-consumption became obsolete and in respect
of Fidejussio was expressly abrogated by J ustinian‚ Cod. 8, 41, 28.

The right of a fidejussor to have a cession from the creditor of
his rights of action is called Beneficium cedendamm actionum. If
he neglected to avail himself of it and of his Beneficium divisionis,
he had no Regressus against his co-sureties‚ Dig. 46, 1, 39.

By the English law, if there be several co-guarantors, and 0118
of them on the default of the principal pay the whole debt or more
than his proportion of it, he may claim contribution against his
co-guarantors‚ and recover for such excess above his proper share.
But if there be three sureties, and one of them‘ be insolvent, and
a second pay the whole debt, at law he can only recover from the
third his proportional share, that is, one third of the debt ς but in

equity he would recover one moiety. The English surely, then,
differs from the fidejussor who had no Regressus.
