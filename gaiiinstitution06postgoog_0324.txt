302 DE RERUM UNIVERSITATIBUS. [11. ἕξ 260-289.

311 days are dies juridici, excepted, besides Sundays and certain
other holidays, two months for harvest and vintage‚ and two weeks
at Easter. J ustinian further appointed, by way of interpolation in
this law, certain vacations at ChristmaS, Epiphany‚ and Pentecost‚
Cod. 3, 12, 7, thus furnishing the model on which the four English
law terms were regulated by Edward the Confessor. subsequently,
the Statute of Westminster, 3, Edward I, permitted assizeS‚ i.c.
trials by jury of issues of fact, to be held in the vacations‚ re-estab-
lishing a distinction corresponding to that of jurisdictional (dies
fasti) and judicial terms (rerum actus): with this difference, however,
that as the same judicial authorities preside over proceedings in
banco, or issues of law, and proceedings at nisi prius, or issues of
fact, the seasons set apart for the latter, that is, the trial terme,
are merely the vacations of the former, that ie, of the sittings
iu bancO. See Puchta‚ Institutionen, ξ 158.

ᾗ 280. After the time of Gaius the liability of a defendant to
interest and profits (fructus) from the date 011 which he was guilty
of MORA appears to have been extended to all leg-acies without excep-
tionT‘ Ex mora praestantiorum fideicommissorum vel legatorum
fructus et usurae peti possunt: mora autem fieri videtur cum pos-
tulanti non datur, Paulus 3, 8, 4. ‘Delay of the heir to satisfy
trusts and legacies entitles the cestui que trust and legatee to fruita
and interest. Delay dates from the ineffectual demand of the
creditor.’

A demand however is not requisite when a term for payment
was fixed in the disposition which gave rise to the debt (ἀίω
adjecta): in other wordS‚ no interpellation is necessary in an obli-
gatio ex die, i. e. an obligatio with a dies adjecta3 for then Mora
begins at the expiration of the term. This is expressed by modern
jurists in the maxim: dies interpellat pro homine: ‘the day de-
mands instead of the creditor.’

A further condition of Mora is the absence of all doubt and dis-
pute, at least of all dispute that is not frivolous and vexatiouS, as to
the existence and amount of the debt. Qui sine dolo malo ad
judicem provocat non videtur moram facere, Dig. 50, 17, 63. ‘ An
honest appeal to a judge is not deemed a mode of Delay!

The date of Mora must not be identified with that of the Nativity
ς of an action (actio nata), an important date, as we shall see, in the
doctrine of Limitation or Prescription of which it is the starting·
point, a starting point that may be antecedent to Mora. Mora
