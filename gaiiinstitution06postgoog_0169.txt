should be confiscated‚ and made it penal in a lawyer to write or
dictate an ungrateful will? Gur, inquit, hoc me potius rogas, quam
ex istis aliquem peritis studiosisque juriS, quos adhibere in consilium
judicaturi soletis? Gellius, 12, 13. ‘ Why do you not consult one
of the lawyers who would sit as your assessor if you were judex ?'
Probably every lawyer was called a juris studiosus until by imperial

diploma he had received the jus respondendi which made him a .

juris auctor.

At a later period we find that institution or preparatory tuition
in law was undertaken by private teachers, who made this a special
occupation. They are alluded to by Ulpian under the name of juris
civilis professores, Dig. 50, 13, 1, 5. They were called professors
because they were required to declare (profiteri) their intention be·
fore some competent authority, from whom they received permission
to pursue their vocation, and they became thereupon entitled to
certain privileges accorded to the professors of a liberal art. They
appear to be distinguished from the practising lawyers in the fol-
lowing passage from Gellius, a contemporary of Gaius: Quaesitum
esse memini in plerisque Romae stationibus jus publice docentium
aut respondentium, an quaestor populi Romani a praetore in jus
vocari posset, 13, 13. ‘The question was canvassed in nearly all
the rooms of the law professors‚ and nearly all the· chambers of the
jur-ists at Rome, whether a quaestor could be summoned by a praetor
to his courtz' where the stationes or standing places of the pro-
fessors and jurists may remind us of the ancient custom of the
English sergeants of meeting their pupils and clients at eertain
pillars in the church of St. Paul's.

In the, time of J ustinian we find professors in the modern sense,
and academie instruction in three public schools of law at Rome,
Constantinople, and Berytus. In a constitution addressed to the
professors (antecessores), and prefixed to the Digest‚ J ustinian
modifies the existing plan of studies, and prescribes what portion
of the Institutions, Digesta, and Code is to be studied in each year

of the quinquennial course.
