Did not tradition, or delivery of possession, operate to engender,

alienation of ownership, 2 ᾇ 65 ¹? This seems the truer view, and i‘f
we use the expression, marriage contract‚ we must use the term
contract not in a specific sense, as opposed to conveyance, but in·
the generic sense of bilateral disposition (as opposed to unilateral
disposition, e. g. testation) a sense embracing both contract proper
and conveyance, and extending beyond the sphere of Property into
the relations of domestic life. Contract proper and conveyance,
though generally contrasted in jurisprudence, have much in com-
mon. If contract in its narrower sense is defined to be the concur-
rence of two manifestations of will creating a jus in personam, and
conveyance the concurrence of two manifestatione of will creating a
jus in rem, the concurrence of two manifestations of will creating a
jus is an element common to both terms of the comparison, and
this common clement may be denominated in a generic sense a
contract. Contract in the narrower sense may then be distinguished
as an obligative contract and conveyance as a translative contract,
and the latter head will include the conti-act of marriage, if we con-

· tinne to employ this expression.

As in respect of property or dominion we find in Roman law the
distinction of Quiritary and Bonitary, that is, of civil and gentile,
ownership, so in respect of the conjugal relation we find the distinc-
tion of Roman or civil marriage (connubium, justae nuptiae, justum
matrimonium) and gentile marriage (nuptiae, matrimonium), of
which the former alone was valid at civil law (connubium est uxoris
jure ducendae facultas, Ulpian, 5, 3 3 ‘ connubium is the capacity of
marriage valid by civil law ’) and capable of producing patria potestas
and agnatio, though the latter produced legitimate children (justi as
opposed to naturales liberi) ,and cognatio or natural relationship.

Capacity of civil marriage (connubium) is (a) absolute and (b)
relative. (a) Only citizens have the absolute capacity of civil
marriage, and such Latine and aliens as are specially-privileged, “
ᾧ 56: slaves are incapable both of civil and gentile marriage.
(b) Capacity of civil marriage is, however, always relative to another
person as forming the other party to the union. A citizen only
has connubium with a citizen or with such Latine and aliens
