the inquiry, is marriage a contract, and, if so, to which class of
Roman contracts, Verbal‚ Literal‚ Real‚ Consensual, 3 ξ 89, is
Roman marriage to be referred Ρ Most writers assume that it was
a Consensual contract, on the strength of texts like the following:
Nuptias non concubitus sed consensus facit, Dig. 35, 1, 15.
‘ Marriage does not depend on cohabitation, but on consent.’ Orto-
lan, however, remarks that consensual contracte could be formed by
absent contractors, Inst. 3, 2, whereas a marriage could not be con-
tracted in the absence of the wife, Paul, 2, 19, 185 and shows that,
besides the consent of the parties, delivery of possession of the wife
to the husband was required, from which he infers that Roman
marriage was not a Consensual but a Real contract. It is true that
marriage might be contracted in the absence of the husband: Vir
absens uxorem ducere potest, femina absens nubere non potest,
Paul, 2, 19, 8 ; but this was only under certain conditions.· Mulierem
absenti per literas ejus vel per nuntium posse nubere placet, si in
domum ejus deduceretur3 eam vero quae abesset ex literis vel
nuntio deduci a marito non posse: deductione enim opus esse in
mariti non in uxoris domum quasi in domicilium matrimonii,
Dig. 23, 21, 5. ‘A man in his absence may marry by letter or
message‚ provided the woman is led to his house: a woman in her
absence cannot marry by letter or message‚ for the leading must be
to the husband's house, as the domicile of the married pair.' And
precisely the same conditione were sufficient in other cases to con-
stitute delivery of possession. Si venditorem quod emerim deponere
in mea domo jusserim, possidere me certum est, quanquam id nemo
dum attigerit, Dig. 41, 2, 18, 2. ‘ If a vendor deposit any article
in my house by my order, I have possession of it though Ι have
never touched it! consensus, then, in the above-quoted passage, is
not opposed to delivery of possession, but to cohabitation, or to the
use of certain words or certain documents, or to the solemn and
graceful ceremonial with which custom surrounded the matrimonial
umon.

Real contracte, however, are executory on one side and executed
on the other, whereas in the conjugal relation both parties are on
the same footing 111 respect of execution 3 and we may ask whether
marriage is a contract at all3 whether it does not rather fall under
the opposite category of alienation or conveyance. Instead of
finding its analogon in locatio-conductio or societas (consensual
contracte) or pig-nus or commodatum (real contracte), may we not
