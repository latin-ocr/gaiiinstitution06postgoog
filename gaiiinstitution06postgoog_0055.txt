Niebuhr) was abolished, though the sanction of the Senate was still
required to give them legal force.

By the second lex Publilia, Niebuhr supposes that the Comitia
Curiata were deprived of their veto on the laws passed at the
Comitia Centuriata, their confirmation being reduced to a form-
ality3 but it was probably merely a ratification of the existing
state of the law, giving the Senate the exclusive initiative in the
legislation of the Comitia centuriata.

By the lex Hortensia, plebiscites were declar-ed to have the force
of law without requiring to be sanctioned by the auctoritas of the
Senate.

After this period the Comitia Tributa and Comitia centuriata
coexisted as concurrent legislative bodieS, the Comitia Tributa
chiefly dealing with matters of private law, the Comitia Centuriata

with public matters, such as electione and questions of peace and
war or alliance.

As Rome grew in opulence, the sums fixed for the census of the
higher classes of the Comitia Centuriata ceased to denote a con-
siderable fortune, and this fact alone would divest this assem bly
of much of its timocratic character. Some further change super-
vened, introducing the Tribal division into the organisation of
the Comitia Centuriata3 but the nature of this change is one
of the obscurest questions in Roman history, and one which we
have no space to investigate.

Plebiscites as well as the enactments of Comitia Centuriata were
called Leges, and were named after the tribunes by whom they
were carried, as the leges proper (rai-ely called populiscitu) were
named after the consul or dictator by whom they were carried.
Thus Lex Canuleia‚ Lex Aquilia, 3 ξ 210, Lex Atinia, Inst. 2, 6, 2,
Lex Furia testamentaria, 2 ξ 225, were plebiscites named after
tribunes, the Lex Valeria Horatia was named after two consule, the
Lex Publilia and Lex Hortensia were named after dictatore.

§4 The legislative power of the senate was in the time of
the republic a matter of controversy. It is certain that it had
a power of issuing certain administrative decrees or instructions
to magistrates that was hardly distinguishable from legislation.
Under the emperors matters were changed. Legislation by the
Comitia, though spoken of by Gaius in the present tense, had
ceased to be a reality aster the time of Tiberius, and the last
recorded lex was passed in the reign of Nerva. As early as the
