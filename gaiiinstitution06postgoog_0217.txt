Adjudication (for the nature of which see 4 ᾧ 42), whereby pro-
perty might be taken from one individual and vested in another
without any of the ordinary methods of conveyance, may be com-
pared in its operation to the vesting orders made by the Court of
Chancery under the Trustee acts, When trustees are disabled by
lunacy or infanoy from dealing with the estates vested in them, the
Court of Chancery is empowered to make orders the effect of which
is that the estate becomes immediately vested in the substituted
trustees as effectually as if a conveyance had been duly made by the
person previously entitled to the legal estate. Another parallel
is to be found in the awai-ds of certain commissioners acting under
powers given by act of parliament. Thus the order of the Inclosure
commissioners for exchange and partition of land closely resembles
in subject and effect the adjudicatio of a judex in the actio finium
regundorum.

Lex is an ambiguous and miscellaneous title. It includes title
by aecheat or forfeiture (caducum) under the lex Papia Poppaea, and
bequest or legacy (legatum), a title deriving its validity from the
lex of the Twelve Tables, Ulpian, 19, 17. Extending our view
from res singulae, to which Ulpian confines himself, to universi-
tates, lex was an apt denomination of title by will at the period
when wills required the ratification of the Comitia Calata, 2 ᾧ 101,
as at that time testamentary dispositions were really acts of the
legislature. Title by lex in this case may be compared to convey-
ances by private act of parliament. in English jurisprudence.

It may assist to clear our conception of title if we observo that
the title ‘ Lege' is ambiguous, and that (1) while one of its mean-
ings implies an absence of all title, (2) another denotes a miscella·-
neous group of heterogeneous titles.

(1) The only case in which Law can be said in any distinctiva
sense to be a cause of acquisition is privilegium or private law.
The acquisition of a right by immediate grant from the sovereign
(private act of the legislature, private act of parliament) is unlike
the acquisition of a person entitled under some general disposition
of a universal law. Aequisition by bequest or escheat is not an
acquisition by law in any pre-eminent manner, but only in the same
degree as is acquisition by mancipation or usucapion or any other
title, for all these acquisitions are equally founded on law or the
