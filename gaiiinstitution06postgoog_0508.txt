486 DE Acmomssus. [nr. §ss 1-9. ·

in personam are Obligations founded on either contract 01· delict.
Primordial rights (life, limb, liberty, honour, &c.), though jura in
rem, do not give rise to real actions3 their violation eng-endere 311
obligation in the violator, which is pursued by a personal action
ex delicto.

A Real action, accordingly, asserts either the status or the pro-
prietorship of the plaintiff, if we include under proprietorship the
¹elements of property called easements 01· servitudes3 a Personal
action 3330113 311 obligation of the defendant towards the plaintiff.

Real and Personal actions of Roman law must not be identified
with those of English law. A Real action in English law may be
defined with sufficient accuracy for our present purpose as an action
whereby we claim property' 111 311 immovable3 a claim of property
in a movable 13 1113110 by Personal action.1n Roman law a claim
of property 111 3 movable 13 3 Real action just 33 11111011 33 3 0131111 of
property 111 311 immovable. A Personal action in Roman law
asserts no property existing in the plaintiff, bnt an obligation or
right to 3 conveyance or transmutation of property from the
defendant 10 1110 plaintiff.

A Real action names no party but the Plaintiff in the 1111011110,
the principal part of the formula or written instructions of the
praetor to the judex, in which the plaintiff ’3 claim is specified3 3
Personal action names the defendant 33 well as the plaintiff in the
intentio. For instance, a vindicatio asserting the status of 3

person contained 311 1111011110 10 11113 effect: Si paret Titium ex jure
Quiritium liberum esse.

 

(We have no record of the precise form of the 1111011110 111 3 0011-
troversy of 3131113. We know that in a question of libertas (liberalis
causa), until the time of Justinian‚ the person whose freedom was
in dispute could not be either plaintiff or defendant, his rights were
advocated by an Assertor, Cod. 7, 17, De assertione tollenda. In
J ustinian’s time the formulary system, with its precisely framea
intentio, no longer existed.) ’

Α vindicatio asserting property in land or a slave contained 311
1111011110 111 these words: Si paret illum fundum—illum hominem—
