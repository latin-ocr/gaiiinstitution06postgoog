The Formless contracte, namely, the Real 6011116616, of which we
have already treated, and the Consensual contracts, of which we
shall 11661 hereafter, cannot, indeed, be enforced in a court of law
unless they are proved to have been concluded, unless, that is,
evidence be given of their existence. But the contract and the

preappointed evidentiary formalitieS‚ the Verbal or Literal contract

§ 94. The obligation of 611 independent sovereign state 10
another independent sovereign 61616 does 1101 resemble 1116 obliga-
tion of one subject 10 another subject of the same sovereign or
political superior. If 6 contract between two subjects is broken,
it is enforced by the power of the common sovereign. But if 6
treaty between two sovereigns is violated‚ there is, by hypothesiS,
no common superior by whom it may be enforced. The 11661166 of
sovereign states correspond 10 1116 1110161 obligations of individuale.
They may be binding in the forum of conscience or of heaven, but,
if these 616 disregarded, are 1101 enforced by any earthly tribunal.
The moral obligation is not secui-ed by any legal sanction3 and
the sovereign whose treaty rights are violated can obtain 110 16111666
except from his own power of inflicting evil on the violator.

Or we may compare the relation of sovereign states 10 1116 re-
lation of individuale before the complete establishment of political
society. There is 111611 sufficient intercourse to form 6 public
opinion and certain conceptions of rights and wrongs3 but not
sufficient organization 10 (1161161166 with the necessity of sslf-vin-
dication or sels-defense. In such a state the redi-ess of the in-

That such a state once existed we know from the early history
of our ancestors and their Teutonic kinsmen. So the redress of
