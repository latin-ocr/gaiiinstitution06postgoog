111. ἕξ 168-181.] LIBERATIO. 443

Id ubi dixit, porcum saxo silice percussit. ‘ After the terms of the
treaty had been recited. Hear, high Jove, he exclaimed3 hear,
thou plenipotentiary of Alba3 hear, thou city of Alba: 'Phose terms
as they were read aloud from first to last from those tablets and
wax without evil intent and as they here to-day are truly under-
stood3 those terms the people of Rome will not be first to violate.
If they are -first to violate them by public resolve with evil intent,
do thou on that day, great Jupiter, so strike the people of Rome
as Ι here to-day will strike this swine: and strike thou so much
the harder as thou art mightier and stronger. This said, he struck
the swine with a hatchet of flint.’ The striking with the flint
curiously corresponds to the striking with the ingot in the Nexum.

The release of a legacy would be operated per aes et libram,
because the will containing the bequest was a transaction per aes et
libram, on the principle that all obligations may be released by the
process whereby they were contracted. Nihil tam naturale est
quam eo genere quidquid dissolvere quo colligatum est, Dig. 50,
17, 35. ⁴ Nothing more natural than the likeness of the means of
binding and of unhindingss Omnia quae jure contrahuntur, con-

charging corresponds a legal form of discharging.' Fere quibus-
cunque modis obligamur, iisdem in contrarium actis liberamur,
Dig. 50, 17, 153. ‘ To every mode of obligation there is an
obverse mode of liberation.’

It is not so easy to explain why a judgment debt could only
be released by the proceeding with the bronze and scales. Perhaps
it was considered that a judgment being an act of the State could
only be discharged by another act of the State, and that the nexum
satisfled this requirement, the witnesses and balance-holder symbol-
izing the people in assembly, and the declaration of the lex of the
nexum symbolizing a legislative enactment. We have an instance ·
of a release from a judgment debt by nexum in Livy. Centurio-
nem, nobilem militaribus factiS, judicatum pecuniae quum duci
vidisset, medio foro cum caterva sua accurrit et manum injecit. . . .
Inde rem creditori palam populo solvit, libraque et aere liberatum
emittit, deos atque homines obtestantem, ut M. Manli0, liberatori
suc, parenti plebis Romanae, gratiam referant, 6, 14. ‘ A centurion
famed for his valour, being condemned for debt and committed to
prison, in the middle of the forum Manlius, with a crowd of fol-
lowers rushing up, interposes as vindex. . . . Then he pays the
