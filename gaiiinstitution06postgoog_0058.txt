preceded, it needs hardly be stated that the antithesis, J us civile,
J us honorarium, is nearly coincident with the antithesiS, J us civile,
J us gentium.

It may be observed that Gaius does not attribute to edicts the
force of a statute: and this theoretical inferiority of J us hono-
rarium, for after all it was only theoretical, had a vast influence
in modelling the forms and proceedings of Roman jurisprudence.
The remedy or redress administered to a plaintiff who based his
claim on J us civile differed from that administered on an appeal
to J us honorarium, as we shall see when we come to treat of Boni-
tary ownership, Bonorum possessiO, Actio in factum, ExceptiO.
This difference of remedy preserved J us civile pure and uncon-
taminated, or at least always distinguishable from J us honorarium;
but this perpetuat-,ion of the memory of the various origins of the
law, like the analogous distinction of Equity and Common law
in English jurisprudence, was purchased by sacrificing for an insuf-
ficient object simplicity of rule and uniformity of process.

'Phe legislative power of the popular assembly and the absence of
legislative power in the senate and praetor were marked by a differ-
ence of style in the lex and plebiscite, edict, and decree of the
senate: while the lex and plebiscite employed the imperative
(damnas esto, jus potestasque est0, δια), the resolutione of the senate
scrupulously avoid the imperative and are clothed in the forms
placere, censere, arbitrari, &c., as if they were rather recommen-
dations than commands: and the edicts and interdicts of the
praetor are couched in the subjunctive (Exhibeas, Restituas, δια), a
milder form of imperative. Or to show that their force and opera-
tion is limited to his own tenure of office, they are expressed in the
first person (actionem dabo, ratum habeb0‚ vim fieri veto). Where
he has authority to command he shows it by using the imperative,
as in addressing the litigante (mittite ambo hominem, inite viam,
redite, 4 ξ 13 com.) or the judge (judex est0, condemnate, absolvito).

In the first period of the empire, that is, in the first three
centuries of our era, it was the policy of the emperors to maintain
a certain show of republican institutions; and the administration
of the empire was nominally divided between the princeps or
emperor and the people as represented by the senate. Thus, at
Rome there were two sets of magistrates, the old republican
magistrates with little real power, consuls, praetors, censors, tri-
