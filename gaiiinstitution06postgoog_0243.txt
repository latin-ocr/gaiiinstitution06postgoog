proceedings of the governor or senate. This was called a public
testament. Savigny, Vermischte schristen, 27.

By English law, 1 Vict. c. 26, only two witnesses are required to
8 will, whether of real or personal estate. The will must be in
writing‚ signed at the end ΒΥ the testator, or by some other person
in his presence and by his direction3 and such signature must be
made or acknowledged by the testator in the presence of the two
witnesses, who must be present at the same time, and who must
attoet and subscribe the will in the presence of the testator.

vatio in ordinandis testamentis mili-

§ 109. But from these strict rules
in the execution of a will soldiers,

tibus propter nimiam inperitiam
constitutionibus Principum remissa
est. nam quamvis neque legitimum
numerum testium adhibuerint, ne-
que vendiderint familiam, neque
nuncupaverint testamentum, recte
nihilominus testantur

§110. Praeterea permissum est
118 81 peregrinos et Latinos institu-
ere heredes vel iis legare: cum
alioquin peregrini quidem ratione
civili prohibeantur capere heredita-
tem legataque, Latini vero per
legem Iuniam.

ξ 111. Caelibes quoque qui lege
Iulia hereditatem legataque capere
vetantur, item orbi, id est qui li-
beros non habent, quos lex Papia
plus quam semissem capere prohibet
(23 lim).

in consideration of their extreme
ignorance of law, have by imperial
constitutions a dispensation. For
neither the legal number of wit-
nesses‚ nor the ceremony of manci-
pation 01· of nuncupation, is neces-
sary to give force to their will.

ᾗ 1 10. Moreover, they may make
aliens and Latini J uniani their heirs
or legatees, whereas under other
wills an alien is disqualified from
taking a succession or legacy by the
civil law, aud Latini J uniani ΒΥ the
lex J unia.

ξ 111. Celibates als0, whom the
lex J ulia disqualifies for taking
successions or legacies‚ and child-
less persons whom the lex Papia
prohibita from taking more than
half a succession or legacy (888
ᾗ 286, are exempt from these in-
capacities under the will of a
soldier.)

ᾧ 109. The military will, which superseded the old testament in
procinctu, could only be executed during actual service, and in this
period only when the soldier was in camp, not when he was at
home or on leave of absence. A will made after the soldier's dis-
charge from service or during his absence from camp was governed

by the same rules as the will of a civilian (paganus). A military .

will, executed without the ordinary formalities, only remained valid
during a year after discharge from service. Inst. 2, 11, 3.
