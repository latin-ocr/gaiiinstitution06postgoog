1v.§§53-60.] OOMI'rY OF NATIONS, FORUM, LEX. 543

question is determined by one of four circumstances: the domicil of
a certain person (testator, intestate, insolvent‚ husband, disposer,
debtor, &c.): the place where the subject of property is situated:
the place of performance of an act past or future (disposition, stipu-
lated service): or the forum before which a cause is litigated.

For Property and Obligation ex contractu the appropriate Law
is the law of the place which supplies the special forum.

Thus in a question of Property the law to be applied is the lex
loci rei Sitae. E. g. in France property passes ΒΥ contract, in Prussia
by tradition. A Frenchman in France sells to another Frenchman
his goods in Prussia. The property only pasees ΒΥ tradition. A
Prussian in Prussia sells to another Prussian his goods in Frauce.
The property pasees by the mere contract of sale.

In a. question of contract the law to be applied is primarily the
lex loci SolutioniS.

The Roman doctrine that Inheritance is a Universal succession
implies that the ideal patrimony has its single seat in the do-
micil of the heritage-leaver and is governed by the law of that
domicil. Thus the law which governs Succession is not, after the
analogy of the former cases, the law of the special forum of Succes-
sion: for whereas the law which governs Succession is the law of
the heritage-leaver’s last Domici13 we have seen that the special
forum of Succession is the forum rei Sitae.

But though the law of the testator’s last domicil principally
governs its dispositione (questions relating to institution, disinheri·
tanee‚ preterition, inofficiodtas, legacies, Sto.) yet there are some
elementa of a will to which other lawa must be applied. 'I'he capa-
city of the testator (testamentifactio, commercium) must exist both
at the date of executing the will and at the date of his decease:
and must be tested at the former date by the law of his then
domicil. Again the capacity of honoratus (heir or legates) is
governed ΒΥ the law of the domicil of honoratus at the time of
testator’s death. Indeed in Roman timae, though not in modern
Germany, this capacity was required at tria tempora, the making of
the will, the death of the testator, and the acquisitio by honoratuS,
p. 224, and was governed at each period by the law of his then
domicil.

The Capacity of a person for contracting and otherwise disposing
ψ is governed by the law of his domicil: with this reservation‚ that
Majority once attained is regarded as a vested right which cannot
