1. §§ 132-136.] Q. M. IUS POTESTATIS SOLVATUR. 111

ξ 131. Τ113 Latini or members of coloniae Latinae were an inter-
mediate class between cives and peregrini. They differed from
peregrini in that they had commercium, i. e. capacity of Quiritary
ownership with its incidente, and they differed from cives in not
having connubium, and consequently being incapable of patria
potestaS, Cic. Pro Caecina, 35. Α Roman citizen could only be-
come a Latin with his own consent. Qui cives Romani in colonias
Latinas proficiscebantur, fieri non poterant Latini ni erant auctores

facti nomenque dederant, Cic. De Dom0‚ 30. ‘ Roman citizens who
went to Latin colonies did not lose their citizenship without volun-

tary enrolment among the colonists!

ξ 132. Emancipation also libe-
rates children from 1113 power of the
parent, a son being liberated by
three mancipations other issue,
male or female, by a single manci-
pation3 for 1113 law of the Twelve
Tables only mentions three manci-
pations in the 3333 of the son, which
it does in the following terms : 113· A
FATHER snm, A son ’11111311 num,
’1113 son 311331, ΒΕ Fam: rnou ‘mn
FATHBB. The ceremony is as follows:
the father manci pates his son to some
one ; 1113 31131133 manumits him by
fictitious vindication, whereupon he
reverte into the power of his father ;
the father again mancipates him to
the same or a different alienes,
usually 10 1113 331113, who again
manumits him by fictitious vindica·-
tion, whereupon he rever-ts a second
time into the power of 1113 father ;
the father 111311 mancipates him a
third time to the same 01· 3 different
31131133, usually 10 1113 331113, and
by this third mancipation the son
ceases 10 113 111 1113 power of the
father even before manumission and
while in the status of a person held
in mancipation. [The alienee or
fiduciary father should then reman-
cipate him to the natural father, in

' order that thereupon the 33111131

father by manumitting him may
acquire the rights of patron instead
of the fiduciary father]
