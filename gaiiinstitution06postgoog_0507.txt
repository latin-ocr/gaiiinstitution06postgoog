1v.§§1-9.] Amorum DIVISIO. · ι 485

In Rome the Remedy was regarded as the certainty3 the Right,
primary or sanctioning, as the matter of deduction. The forms of
Action, emphatically so in Statute-process and to a great degree in
the Formulary system, as crystallized in the law or in the edict,
were capable of enumeration and incapable of multiplication3 aud
from these forms the citizen might deduce the list of his rights and
obligatione. The logic of the ancient jurist may be expressed in
the maxim: Where there is a Remedy there is a Right: There is
no Right unless there is a Remedy.

The modern jurist assumes the other, the more ideal of the two
correlated terms, to be the more evident, and acts upon the converse
maxim: Where there is a Right there is a Remedy 3 or, Given the
ssight, the Remedy follows. The action now is the dependent term:
its forms are unimportant and indefinitely variable3 they are no
longer crystallizations. If a Right is established ‘and no appro-
priate form of action seems to exist, a new one is forthwith invented,
and its fitness to enforce the established right is sufficient to pro-
cure its recognition by the judicature. Such at least, if not opposite
goals at which ancient and modern jurisprudence have arrived, ap-

pear to be opposite directions in which they diverge. Ibering‚ ξ 50.
⁸ Sponsio or wager was an indirect mode of submitting questions
to judicial decision, which seems to have been very commonly
employed before the introduction of the formulary system. We are
left to conjecture how its classification enabled any jurist to count ’
four classes of action. Its principal division seems to be into the
sponsio where the pecuniary risk was serious and the penal sum
important (sponsio poenalis), and the sponsio where the penal sum
was nominal and not actually exacted (sponsio praejudicialis). Add-
ing these two divisions to real and personal actions, we should have
four classes. But as every sponsiO, asserting an obligation arising
from stipulation, was a species of personal action, this classification
would involve a co-ordination of sub-genera and genera, or sub-
divisions and divisions·

A Real action is one which asserts a jus in rem, a Personal action
one which asserts a jus in personam. A jus in rem, we may
remember, is a right to certain 'forbearances, or freedom from
molestation, corresponding to a duty imposed on all the world; a

jus in personam is a right to certain performances corresponding to
a duty imposed on a determinate person. J ura in rem are Status,

or Property, or Servitude, that is, some fraction of property. Jura
