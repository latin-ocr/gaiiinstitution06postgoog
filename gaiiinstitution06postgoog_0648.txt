626 DE AC'PIONIBUS. [Ν. §§ 138-170.

rem). Thus interdictum Salvianum, ᾧ 147, protecte the landlord
in the recovery of his rent by enforcing his pignus on the movables
of the lessee.

(2) In the code of rerum universitas we have the interdicta
Quorum bonorum, ᾗ 144, and Quod legatorum, Dig. 43, 4, in aid
of the universal successor.

D. In the code of Procedure we have the interdicta Quem fun-
dum, Quam hereditatem, Quem usumfructum, § 89, and the
interdicta Secundaria, ᾧ 170, compelling· a defendant in a real
action to defend himself in the mode prescribed by the legislator
under pain of forfeiting possession. Here too we may place the
interdicte Utrubi and Uti possidetis so far as they are not them·
selves final suits but only means of determining provisional or
interimistic possession during the pendency of the definitive vindi-
catio: and here too, if we look on Quorum bonorum as standing to
hereditatis petitio in the same relation in which Uti possidetis
stands to vindicatio, i. e. as merely preparatory to the final suit, we
may place the interdict Quorum bonorum. At a later stag-e of
proceedings the interdict Ne vis fiat ei qui in possessionem missus
erit, Dig. 42, 4, protects the creditor who has obtained execution.
The interdictum fraudatorium protects the creditor against fraudu-
lent alienation by an insolvent debtor, Dig. 42, 8 : the interdictum
possessorium and interdictum sectorium, ᾧ 145, protect the pur·
chaser of the estate of the insolvent or the condemned criminal.

As an alternative to some of these interdicte, the plaintiff had his
option of an actio in factum: e. g. an alternative to interdictum
Salvianum was actio Serviana, ᾗ 35; and an alternative to inter-
dictum fraudatorium was actio Pauliana.

ᾧ 140. Restituere in respect of the acts which it denotes is a
word of many meanings, and comprehends several acts which in
physical character have little in common but the name. Sometimes
it means the demolition' of an unlawfnl structure. e. g. Quod in
flumine publico ripave ejus fiat, sive quid 1n id flumen ripamve ejus
immissum habeas, quo statio iterve navigio deterior sit, fiat, resti-
· tuas,Dig.43,12,1‚19. ‘What you have built ln a public river or
on its bank, or what you have discharged into the river or on to its
bank, interfering with the anchorage or passage of vessels, I corn-
mand you to demolish and remove? Sometimes it means the
restoration of possession, as iu.the interdict Unde vi, ᾗ 154; some-
times tlie delivery of possession, where no possession has preceded,
