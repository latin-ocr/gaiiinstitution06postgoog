154 DE PERSONIS. [1. ξς 197-200.

Some Universitiee have a visible existence in a number of indi-
vidual members, and are then called Corporations. An essential
incident of Corporatione is that their rights are not vested in the
aggregate of individuale, but in the ideal whole, regarded as distinct
from the members of which it is composed. Examples of such Cor-
porations are municipalities (civitas, municipium, respublica, com-
munitas), colleges of priestS, of Vestal Virgine, corporations of
subordinate officials, e. g. lictors, notariee (scribae, decuriae), in-
dustrial guilds, e. g. emithS, haltere, potterS, shipownere, mining
companies (aurifodinarum, argentifodinarum, salinarum, societas),
contractors for the revenue (vectigalium publicorum societas), social
clube (sodalitates, sodalitia), friendly societies (tenuiorum collegia).

Other juristic persone, not eo visibly embodied in any natural
individuale, e. g. churches, hospitale, almshousee, or any other
beneficent aime personified, are called, not Corporatione but, Foun-
datione.

The state as a juristic person, invested with rights of property,
was called in the time of the republic AErarium. Under the first
emperors, when the public treasure was divided between the em-
peror and the senate, the senate, as a juristic person representing
the republic, was called AErarium, while the emperor was called
Fiscus. At an uncertain date, about the time of Gaius, when all
power was undisguieedly absorbed by the emperor, and the public
cheets were united, the terme AErarium and Recus lost their dis-
tinctive meanings‚ and we find them used convertibly in the compi-
latione of J ustinian.

J uristic persons, though invested with rights of property, being
mere fictione or ideal unitieS, are incapable of making a disposition
(declaration of intention); for how can a fiction have an intention ⁴?
It is true that slaves could acquire property and active obligations
for their proprietors ς but a slave could not aliene property, nor
incur a passive obligation‚ nor enter into a bilateral contract, nor be
a party to a suit: and therefore Universitiee could not make such
dispositione by means of their slaves. In this respect they resemble
infante and lunatice,- and ae infante and lunatice must be represented
by their guardians and curatore, so juristic persons must be repre-
sented by the agents designated and defined by their constitution.
The temporary representative of a Corporation for the purpose
of suing and being saed, was called Actor ς a permanent repre-
sentative for this purpose was called Syndicus, D. 3, 4, 1. The
