FORMAL ALIENATION. 666

The difficulty vanishes in Mancipation and J udicial Surrender.
Their forms comprehend a most emphatic and trenchant expression
of intention. ‘ I am invested with dominion ' (hunc ego hominem
meum esse aio) is the exclamation of the alienes, confirmed ΒΥ the
assent of the alienor, in both modes of Formal alienation.

(2) Formless dispositions whether alienatione or conventione may
leave a doubt not only which of several intentione governed a pro·
cedure but whether any intention at all had been matured in the
minds of the negotiatore. Had the parties passed the stage of mere
contemplation, inclination, preliminary discussion, were they still
vacillating, now yielding to an attractive prospect, now receding from
half-made concessione P Or had cupidity and timidity, desire and
hesitation, given place to final deeision and deliberate resolve Ρ It
is obvious that the formalities of the solemn modes of contract were
invented for the purpose of'excluding all doubt from the answers to
these questions·

Beginning these remarks we adjoumed the consideration of Dona-
tion, which may now be noticed. Unilateral dispositions, we have
seen, do not exist in the actual world unaccompanied. Each im-
plies another on which it leans. Intention to incur a loss has its
final and efficient cause in intention to procure a gain. If this was
universally true we might say that all dispositione were bilateral:
i. e. that in all a pecuniary loss incurred at one sta'ge of the tran-
saction is balanced ΒΥ a pecuniary gain accomplished at another.
This holds of all mercantile transactions which are the bulk of those
that occupy the attention of jurisprudence. The market, however,
is not the whole of the world, nor are mercenary acts the whole of
life3 and there is such a thing as a disinterested disposition, a dis-
position wherein a man incurs a loss to which the causa or motor
factor is the intention not of counterbalancing gain in another part
of the transaction, but of pure and simple and unrequited liberality.

Donation may be found in the sphere either of Dominion or of
Obligation 3 it may be accomplished either ΒΥ alienation or by
promise: the intention of liberality may be consummated either ΒΥ
Tradition or ΒΥ Stipulation. Donation, that is to say, is one of the
causae obligationis as well as a justa causa traditionis: and it was
in contemplation of a contract animated ΒΥ such a cause that we
abstained when beginning this note from saying unreservedly that
all actual conventione were bilateral.
