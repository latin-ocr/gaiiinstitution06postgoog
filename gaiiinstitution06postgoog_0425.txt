111. ἕξ 110-127.] INTERCESSIO. 403

ᾦ 122. Τ116 lex Apuleia, which gave the sponsor or fidepromissor
the action pro socio, whereby he could recover by contribution from
his co-guarantors whatever he had paid in excess of his propor-
tionate share, was passed B.0. 102. It was the rule of the provinces
66 the lex Furia was the rule of Italy.

ᾧ 123. For the illegible name of the law requiring the principal
to give information of the amount of the debt and the number of
co-sureties various guesses have been made by different critice—-

 

Porcia, Petreia, Cornelia, Pompeia, Apuleia. ῧέωόἱυ J -

ξ 124. The lex Cornelia, the first which mentions the fidejussor
as well as the sponsor and fidepromissor, limiting the amount for
which the same guarantor could be bound 66 security for a con-
tract either of mutuum or of stipulatio in the same year for the
same principal to the same guarantee‚ was passed in the dictator-
ship of Sylla, Β.ο. 81, and seems to show that the stringency of
the lex Furia had led to a more frequent employment of the fide· ·
jussor in place of the sponsor and fidepromissor. The sponsor and
fidepromissor have vanished from the legislation of J ustinian.

ᾧ 125. Perhaps for vicesima we should read vicesimaria or
vicesimae. 'I'he lex J ulia vicesimaria was a law of Augustus,
imposing, in support of the military treasury‚ a succession duty
of one twentieth of the value on the testamentary succession of
all cives Romani.

§ 127. Τ116 lex Publilia, which enabled a sponsor who had paid the
debt of his principal, unless reimbursed within six months, to recover
by actio depensi‚ a form of manus injectio pro judicato (Gaius, 4
ᾦ 22), twice the amount of the original debt, is of uncertain date.

If a fidejussor, instead of claiming· the reduction of his liability
by division among· the co-fidejussors under the epistle of Hadrian,
was prepared to pay the whole debt, 116 could require the creditor
to cede to him his actions against the principal debtor and the
co-fidejussors, and then paying the creditor, not as surety (for then
the debt and right of action would be extinguished)‚ but 66 pur-
6116661 of the debt, he could be appointed procurator of the creditor
(receive a power of attorney), and would be able to sue in the name
of the creditor for his own benefit. Fidejussoribus succurri solet,
ut stipulator compellatur ei qui solidum solvere paratus est, vendere
ceterorum nomina, Dig. 46, 1, 17. ‘ Guarantors are relieved by
the guarantee being· compelled‚ if one is ready to pay the whole,
to 6611 him the debt of the others? Cum quis, et reum et fide--
