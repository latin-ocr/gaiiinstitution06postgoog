the formula, still to be found in the Digest, of the interdict Quorum
bonorum, 4 ᾧ 144, the remedy whereby a person who claimed not
as civil heir (heres), but as praetorian successor (bonorum posseaeor) ‚
established 1116 right to succeed and recovered possession of the
hereditamentS. '1¹0 leave these traces in the wording of the inter-
dict was according to Vangerow no oversight on the part of J us-
tinian, as although in his legislation the last remnants of the
institution of usucapio pro possessore, that is by a mala fide pos-
sessor, had been definitively abolished3 yet usucapio pro herede,
that is, by a bona fide possessor, or one who sincerely though
mistakenly held himself to be heir, was still recognized by juris-
prudence, ᾧ 320.

ᾧ 61. Τ116 circumstances contemplated seem to 116 86 follows: A
proprietor is debtor to the state, and 1116 lands are mortgaged as
security for the debt. On default of payment, the state exercises
the power of sale: if the debtor is⁸not turned out of possession by
the purchaser (praediator) in two years he recovers his proprietor-

a possessor to appeal for the protection of his possession to the
praetor’s interdict were merely that it should be adverse (with the
knowledge of the other party and without his permission), and, in
respect of the other party, commenced without violence (nec vi nec
clam nec precario). To produce Usucapion (1) the thing to be ac·

violence from the former proprietor3 (2) the possession of the
usucapient must be based on a justa causa or titulus, such as con·
tract or bequest 3 (3) and commenced with bona fides on his part.
Bona fides, in the case of original acquisition, e. g. usucapio pro

In the case of derivative acquisition it is the belief that the auctor,
or person from whom the thing is derived, is either proprietor or,
if not proprietor, has a power of disposition as agent, guardian,
