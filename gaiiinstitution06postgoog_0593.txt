ξ 108. Alia causa fuit olim legis
actionum. nam qua de re actum
semel erat, de ea postea ipso iure
agi non poterat· nec omnino ita,
ut nunc, usus erat illis temporibus
exceptionum.

§ 109. Ceterum potest ex lege
quidem esse iudicium, sed legitimum
non essej, et contra ex lege non
esse, sed legitimum esse. ‘nam si
verbi gratia ex lege Aquilia vel
Ouinia vel Furia in provinciis aga·
tur, imperio continebitur iudicium:
idemque iuris est et si Romae aput
recuperatores agamus, vel aput unum
iudicem interveniente peregrini per-

ex qua nobis edicto Praetoris datur
acti0, Romae sub uno iudice inter
omnes cives Romanos accipiatur

IMPERIUM.

plea of previous decision or liti-
gation is necessary.

§ 108. It was otherwise anciently
with the forms of statute-process,
when a subsequent action on the
same question was always ex-
tinctively barred, and counteractive
pleae were unknown to the code of
procedure.

ξ 109. An action maybefounded
on statute and yet not be statutable,
or statutable and yet not founded
on statute. For instance, an action
founded on the lex Aquilia, or
Ovinia, or Furia, if instituted in
the provinces, determines with the
praetorship, and so it does if insti·
tuted at Rome before recuperatore,
or though instituted before a single
judex, if the judex or a party is an
alien; and, on the contrary, an
action founded on the edict, if· in-
stituted at Rome, before a single

iudicium, legitimum est. judex, between Roman citizens, is

statutable.

Imperium and J urisdictio were the two component parts of
Officium jus dicentis, i. e. the power of the magistrate (consul,
praetor, curule edile) charged with the administration of civil
justice.

Of these two elements, J urisdictio denoted the power (perhaps
originally vested in the Pontifex) of administering the civil law in
the ordinary course of procedure. It consisted chiefly in presiding
over the preliminary stages of litigation, and in the period of
leg-is actiones was summed up in the utterance of the solemn
words, De, Dico, Addico; but in the formulary period it was
performed, not by oral utterances, but ΒΥ the delivery of written⁴
documents (verbis conceptis). In genuine litigation it was called
jurisdictio contentiosa3 in fictitious litigation, e. g. manumission
by vindicta, alienation ΒΥ in jure cessio, it was called jurisdictio
voluntaria.

Imperium as coupled with the administration of civil justice
(imperium quod jurisdictioni cohaeret, Dig. 1, 21, 1), or as inclu-
ding· it (cui etiam jurisdictio inest, Dig. 2, 1, 3), was called im-
perium mixtum, as opposed to imperium merum, or gladii potestas,
