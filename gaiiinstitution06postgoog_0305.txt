ξ 244. Cedere diem significat incipere deberi pecuniam3 venire
diem significat eum diem venisse quo pecunia peti possit, Dig. 50,
16, 213. ‘ Cedit dies denotes the moment when a right to receive
payment vests3 venit dies denotes the moment when payment may
be exacted.’

A right to a conditional legacy vested when the condition was
accomplished. Herein a conditional legaey differs from a conditional
contract. A fulfilled condition of a contraet or promise is retracted
to the date of the promise: i. e. the obligation of the promissor and
the right of the promissee date from the conclusion of the contract
as if it had been originally unconditional. Though an unconditional
legacy was liable to be defeaoed by the heres deelining the inherit-
auce, or the will from any other cause failing of operation, yet, as
soon as the validity of the will was ascertained by the aditio of the
heres, the vesting of an unconditional leg-acy dated back from the
death of the testator.

One of the Catos was the author of a maxim, that to test the
validity of a legacy we must examine whether it would be valid
if the testator died immediately aster executing his will. This
was called regula Catoniana, Dig. 34, 7, 1. The retroactive effect
of the removal of an original impediment to the validity of a title
is called the Convalescence of the title. Accordingly, Cato’s rule
may be described as a rule denying the convalescence of leg-acies.
Cato’s rule, however, was only a criterion of the validity of uncon-
ditional bequests3 the validity of conditional bequests can only be
tested when the condition is accomplished. Accordingly, of the
three opinions mentioned in this paragraph, that of Sabinus is
to be regarded as sound, and is so treated by J ustinian, Inst. 2,
20, 32.
