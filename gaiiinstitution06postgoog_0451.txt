vey to me for the price at which I
authorized you to buy: so Sabinus
and Cassius have decided. If you
buy it for less, you will have a right
of action against me, for a direction
to buy for a hundred thousand ses-
terces is regarded as an implied
direction to buy, if possible, for any
smaller sum.

have been a letting and hiring, is
ground for an action of mandate

In the contract of agency (mandatum) the principal is called
dominus or mandator, the agent procurator or mandatary.

We have already mentioned, when treating. of the verbal con-
tract of stipulation, that a guaranty was often given by the con-
sensual contract of mandate. Such a mandate was called MANDATUM
quarmoamn. We have the principle explained in ξ 156 (where
the hiatus may be supplied from J ustinian: sed obtinuit Sabini
sententia obligatorium esse in hoc casu mandatum): he who recom‘-
mends a third person as of good credit is bound to make good his
representation and to indemnisy another who sustains damage from
giving credit on the saith of that representation. So by English
law a person not interested in a transaction who makes a false and
fraudulent misrepresentation which induces another to trust and
contract with a third person is answerable for the loss occasioned
by his misrepresentation.

As such a representation was in effect a guaranty, and to allow
an action on a verbal misrepresentation would avoid the Statute of
FraudS, which requires a guaranty to be reduced to writing, Lord
Tenterden’s Act, 9 George IV, chapter 14, enacted that no action
shall be brought whereby to charge any person upon any repre-
sentation or assurance concerning the character, credit, or ability
of any other person, to the intent that such other person may
obtain money or goods upon credit, unless such representation or

assurance be made in writing‚ signed by the party to be charged
therewith.
