18 PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS.

when he means another: in a marriage, if one goes through the
eeremony with a person other than he supposes: in a donation,
when a donor gives a thing to a person who falsely personates
the intended donee: in a contract, when an order for a work of
art is given to a person who falsely personates an eminent artist.

3. Error respecting the Thing to be conveyed is called (a) error in
corpore when it relates to an individual thing3 as when there is a mis-
understanding between buyer and seller or other contractors as to
the specific thing to be conveyed3 and this avoids the contract. When
a Quantitas, ‚that is, a thing only generically determinate is to be
conveyed, a misunderstanding sometimes avoids a contract‚ sometimes
leaves a valid eontract for the lesser of the two quanfities intended.

(b) Sometimes error respecting the Qualities of the thing to ’

be conveyed, called inappropriately error in substantia, is held to be
essential and avoids a disposition: thus a buyer may think a bronze
vessel to be golden‚ or a leaden vessel to be silver‚ or vinegar to be
wine, or a female slave to be a male slave. ln such cases, whenever
the difference of quality in the judgment of the -mercantile world
would make a commodity different in kind, the error is essential²
when the difference does not amount to a difference in kind, the
error is held to be non-essential and does not avoid the disposition.

Other errors than these three, however closely they may be
connected with a disposition, and though they may have been the
principal inducements theretO, are unessential or immaterial and leave
the disposition valid. Only testamentary dispositione are in some
casae invalidated by an error in Motive. E. g. the institution of a
person as successor because a previously instituted successor or
an intestate successor is falsely believed to be deceased: the insti-
tution of a person as successor because he i‘s falsely believed to be
a relative: the disinheritance inter ceteros of a son because he is
falsely believed to be dead: the bequest of property belonging to a
sti-anger which the testator believes to be his own: all these testa-
mentary dispositione are invalidated by error.

Sometimes Error, though it does not operate so far as to invali-
date a disposition, yet entitles the disposer to relief at the hands of
the tribunals, particularly if it was produced by the fraud (dolus)
of another party. In most countries the mitigation of the strict
legal consequences of dispositione is the work of that branch of the
judicature which administers what is called Equity in conti-ast with
the tribunale that administer the more rigorous rules of law (jus
