ΒΥ whom the first Assignatarius receives payment.

We know that Cicero pater supplied Cicero filius when a student

at Athens with money by the mediation of his friend Atticus who,

as publican, had debtors in Greece. The procedure would be as l

follows t

Atticus (A, assignator) at the request of Cicero pater (C, assig- ἒ

natarius primus), orders Graeculus (B, assignatus) to pay to Cicero
filius (D, assignatarius secundus) what Atticus owes to Cicero pater.
The payment by Graeculus to Assignatarius secundus, D, discharges
the debt of Graeculus to Atticae, the debt of Atticus to Cicero
pater, and if D were an independent person, creditor of Cicero pater,
the debt of Cicero pater to D.

The translation of 3 ᾧ 1⁷4 supposes a recital by Gaius of the
formula employed in the discharge of the ancient contract of Nexum
as well as that employed in the discharge of a judgment debtor
from his obligation under a judgment. But Nexum had been so
long obsolete that Gaius can hardly have thought it necessary to
mention its formula3 and doubtless the· present paragraph treated
solely of the release of judicatus. The words: Si quid eo nomine
debeatur quod per aes et libram gestum est, ᾧ 173, which suggest
a notice of Nexum, refer not to Nexum proper but to legatum per
damnationem, an obligation imposed ΒΥ a mancipatory or Nexum-
like will: and the formula for releasing this is given, ᾧ 175.

What then, assuming (what is doubtful) that we have the true
reading of the text, is the meaning of the last words of the formula
for releasing a judgment debt: lege jure obligatur? In the lex
J ulia municipalis (Tabula Heracleensis) the words: si is jure lege
damnatus esset, are explained by Savigny as equivalent to: si is
judicio legitimo (3 ᾧ 180) damnatus esset, Vermischte Schriften 34,
p. 387. But in the well known fragment of the Twelve Tables:
rebusque jure judicatis, jure is equivalent to legis actione. The
words: lege jure obligatur, then, at the close of the formula may
be supposed to denote a debt created either ΒΥ statute-process (legis
actio) or by statutory suit (judicium legitimum): and we may
imagine that no obligation of a less primitive character would re-
quire to be released by the formality of nexi liberati0.
