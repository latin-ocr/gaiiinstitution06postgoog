PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS. 19

ipm). In Rome such relies was given by the praetor in his
equitable capacity under the forms of Exceptio, Actio, In inte-
grum restitutio, the natures of which will appear in the course of
this treatise. It was sometimes, however, given by the courts of
civil law (jus strictum) 3 for instance in the action called Qndictio
Q If a person aliened property in the mistaken belief
that he was under an obligation to do so, he could recover it back
in the courts of civil law by this action, which belonged to the
class of personal actions and claimed a reconveyance of property.
The nature of the remedy indicates that the error of fact had not
invalidated the alienation. Otherwise the remedy would not have
been a condictio claiming a retransfer, 11111 6 vindicatio, a real
action, contending that the property had never been effectually
aliened, that the attempted transfer was inoperative.

We have seen that ignorance of the specific constituente of an
6611011 16 6 ground of exculpation. This must not be extended to
ignorance of the obligations to which a person is subject under
certain circumstances, or of the sanctions by which these obliga-
tions are enforced. Hence the maxim that a party in a suit may
611686 ignorance of fact, but cannot allege ignorance of law. Regula
est, juris quidem ignorantiam cuique nocere, facti vero ignorantiam
non nocere, Dig. 22, 6, pr. Sciant ignorantiam sacti non juris
prodesse, nec stultis solere succurri sed errantibus, ibid. ξ 5. ‘ The
rule is, that law is known to everybody at his own peril, facts are
not known to everybody at his own peril? ‘ Ignorance of fact may
be pleaded‚ not ignorance of law ς and relies is accorded to error, but
not to stupidity) The rule is founded on expediency. It would be
impossible for a court to 11661116 whether a party was really ignorant
of the law, or, if this could be determined‚ whether his ignorance
was inevitable or the effect of negligence. From the impossibility
of deciding such a plea, it is not allowed to be pleaded‚ and igno—
rance of law is always assumed to be a case of Negligence‚ and
unworthy of the sovereign’s relief.

This distinction of Roman jurisprudence is parallel to 006 indi-
cated by the Grecian moralist. Οὐ γὰρ ἡ ἑν τῇ προαιρέσει ἄγνοια
αἰτία τοῦ ἆκουσίου ἀλλὰ τῆς μοχθηρίας, οὐδ’ ἡ καθόλου, ψέγουται γὰρ
