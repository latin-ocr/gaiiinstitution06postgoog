n. ἕξ 260-289.] TERMS AND VAOATIONS. 301

ξ279. The law terms at Rome during the greater part 01 1116
formulary period, were of two different kinds: (1) the juridical
term or term for jurisdictio, and (2) the judicial term or term for
trials.

(1) 'I'he term for jurisdiction, that 13, 101 1116 solemn acts 01 1116
praetor sitting on the tribunal in his court in the comitium, was
that originally prescribed 101 the ancient legis actiones. The year
was divides into forty dies fasti, unoonditionally allotted to ,ιιι-11111331
proceedings, one hundred and ninety dies comitiales, available for
juridical purposes unless required for the legislative assemblies, dies
intercisi, 01 which certain hours were available for jurisdiction, 3011
sixty dies nefasti, which were absolutely unavailable for juridieal
proceedjngs. ·

(2) J udicia, or trials before a judex in the forum, were unaffected
by dies fasti and nefasti, but dependent on another division, dies
festi and profesti: dies festi (days devoted 130 161136, 10111, epulae,
sacrificia) being exempted from litigation. Besides these occasional
interruptions 01 1111831100, there were longer set vacations, which
we find rearranged 00 several occasions. Thus at one time we find
two judicial 161103 (rerum actus, 0010 163 3800101) 10 1116 year, a
winter and a summer term, and two vacations, one in spring and
another in autumn. Claudius substituted a single vacation at the
close of the year, and made the law term continuous. Rerum actum,
divisum antea 10 hibernos aestivosque menses, conjunxit, SuetoniuS,
Claudius, 23. Galba abolished this vacation, 3011 confined the
intervals 01 litigation to dies feriati. Marcus Aurelius, in the time
of Gaius, abolished the distinction between the jurisdiction term
(dies fasti) and the trial term (rerum actus). He devoted two hun-
dred 3011 thirty days (adding the number of dies fasti to the number
of dies comitiales) to forensic proceedings, under the name 01 dies
juridici or dies judiciarii, 3011 allowed even the rest of the year, dies
feriati, to be used for litigation with the consent of the parties.
J udiciariae rei singularem diligentiam adhibuit: fastis dies J udici-
arios addidit, ita ut ducentos triginta dies annuos rebus agendis
