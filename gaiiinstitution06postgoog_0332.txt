time of his father’s death. A wife
in the hand of a grandson is a sels-
successor, subject to the same pro-
viso, because she is a quasi great·
granddaughter.

§ 4. After-born children, wh0, if
born in the lifetime of the parent,
would have been subject to his
power, are sels-successore.

ξ 5. Also those in whose behalf
the provisions of the lex Aelia
Sentia (1 ξ 32) or the senatuscon-
sult have been satisfied ΒΥ proof of
excusable error subsequently to the
death of the parent, for if the error
had been proved in the lifetime of
the parent they would have been
subject to his power.

ξ 6. Also, a son, who has under-
gone a first or second mancipation
and is manumitted after the death
of the father, is a aelf-successor.

ξ 7. Accordingly, a son or
daughter and grandchildren ΒΥ an-
other son are called contemporane-
ously to the succession ; nor does
the nearer grade exclude the more
remote, for justice seemed to dic·
tate that grandchildren should suc-
ceed to their father’s place and
portion. Similarly, a grandchild by
a son and a great-grandchild ΒΥ
a grandson ΒΥ a son are called con-
temporaneously to the succession.

ᾗ 8. And as it was deemed to be
just that grandchildren and great·
grandchildren should succeed to
their father’s place, it seemed con-
sistent that the number of stems,
and not the number of individuale,
should be the divisor of the suc-
cession3 so that a son should take
a moiety, and grandchildren by
another son the other moiety; or
if two sons lest children, that a
single grandchild or two grand-
children by one son should take
one moiety, and three or four
grandchildren by the other son the
other moiety.
