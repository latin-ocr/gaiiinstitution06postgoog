44 DE PERsoMs [1. ξ s.

These, however, are not the special and exceptional rights of certain
eminently privileged classeS, but the ordinary rights of all the
community‚ at least of all who live under the protection of the
law3 they belong to filiusfamilias as well as to paterfamilia5‚ to
peregrinus and latinus as well as to civis. The rights in question,
that is to say, do not belong to the law of unequal rights, or the

law of PersonS, but to the law of equal rights, or the law of

Things.

The anomalous institution of slavery, however, furnishes a ground
for controverting this arrangement; for, as by this legalized
iniquity of ancient law, the slave, living as he did, not so much
under the protection as under the oppression of the law, was
denuded of all the rights of humanity‚ including those of which
we speak, we cannot say that these rights belong to servus as
well as to liber. The same, however, may be said of contract
rights and rights of ownership, for the slave had neither part
nor lot in these any more than in the right of a man to the
use of his own limbs. In defining, therefore, jura rerum to be
the equal rights of all, we must be understood 10 1110311, of all who

treats of rights irrespectively both of the equality and the inequality
of the persons in whom they are vested, leaving their equal or
unequal distribution to be determined by jus personarum.

In order to mark the natural position of these rights in the civil
code, I have avoided designating them, with Blackstone, by the
name of Personal rights, a term which I am precluded from using
by yet another reason. Ι have employed the terms Persona] right
and Real right to mark the antithesis of rights against a single
debtor and rights against the universe. Now the rights in ques-
tion are rights that imply a negative obligation incumbent on all
the world, that is to say, in our sense of the words they are not
Personal, but Real.

As contrasted with Acquired rights (Erworbene rechte, jus 01130-
situm) they are called Birthrights or PRIMORDIAL rights
(Urrechte), names which are open to objection‚ as they may seem to
imply a superior· dignity of these rights, or an independence, in
contrast with other rights, of positive legislation, characters which
