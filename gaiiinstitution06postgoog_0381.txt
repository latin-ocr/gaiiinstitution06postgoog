tion, however, which is recognized by Positive law in various
operatione, e. g. as founding a defence called ExceptiO, i. e. a con-
tentiou that the right of the plaintiff', though not nullified, is
counteracted by an opposing right os the defendant; as giving a
right of Retention (barring condictio indebiti soluti) and Compen-
sation3 and as forming a basis of various Accessory institutes of
Civil law, such as Novatio, Pignus, Fidejussio, Constitutum.

Naturalis obligatio, with its partial and occasional protection,
‚may seem a singular and anomalous institute of Roman law, but it
is paralleled by the recognition, though to a very minor extent,
of Imperfect obligations in English jurisprudence. Imperfect
obligations are so called, not because they are less binding in the
forum of conscience than those which are perfect, but because they
are not directly enforced by political sanctione, because various
motives induce the political legislator to exempt the debtor from
positive coercion. Instances of iinperfect obligation are, debts con-
tracted in infancy, debts barred by a statute of limitatione, debts
discharged by adj udication of bankruptcy. A ratification in writing
after the attainment of majority, or 'a written promise to pay by the
bankrupt or debtor discharged by limitation, perfecte aud revives
the imperfect obligation, and makes it ground to support an action.
As in English law a merely moral duty is an inadequate considera-
tion to support and validate a promise to pay, the validity of such
ratificatory promises shows conclusively that the obligation of the
infant, the insolvent, the debtor discharged by limitation, is re-
garded in English jurisprudence as something more than a moral
obligation, as, to a certain extent, a legal obligation3 that is, is
viewed by English tribunals in the light in which naturalis
obligatio was viewed by Roman tribunale.

Civil obligations fall under two principal classes: (1) those to
which the title or investitive fact is a CONTRAo'r3 and (2) those
to which the title or investitive fact is a numer. In obligation
created by COchT there are two stages: there is first a primary
or sanctioned Personal right antecedent to wrong, and afterwards
a secondary or sanctioning Personal right consequent on a wrong.
In obligation founded on mmor there is the second stage, a
secondary or sanctioning Personal right consequent on a wrong, but
the first stage is not a Personal right (jus in personam), but a Real
right (jus in rem), whether a Primordial right, right of Status, or

of Proper-ty.
