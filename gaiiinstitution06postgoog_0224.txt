Tradition‚ or transfer of physical control, without any further ele·
ment of Time, cannot pass Dominion‚ for in Loan for use (commo-
datum) tradition merely passes Detention without Possession3 in
Pledge (pignus), it passes Possession without Property3 in Deposit,
it sometimes passes Detention and sometimes Possession. The cases
in which Proper-ty is passed by Tradition may be reduced to three
classes, traditio donandi animo, traditio credendi animo, and tra-
ditio solvendi animo. In the first, it simply confers property on
the donee3 in the second, it confers property on the transferes,
and subjects him to an obligation3 in the third, it confers property
on the transferes, and discharges the transferor of an obligation.
In the two latter cases, i. e. tradition by way of loan (mutui datio)
and tradition by way of payment (solutio), the titulus, or justa causa
accompanying tradition, contains much that is unessential to the
transfer of dominion, the only absolutely essential element being the
intention of the parties to give and take dominion, In Donation,
the justa causa traditionis consists solely of this essentia] clement.
The justa causa, then, which must accompany tradition, is the ani-
mus or voluntas transferendi dominii, and this, apparently, is given
as the whole of the matter in a passage of Gaius quoted in the
Digest: Hae quoque ree, quae traditione nostrae fiunt, jure gentium
nobis acquiruntur3 nihil enim tam conveniens est naturali aequitati,
quam voluntatem domini volentis rem suam in alium transferre
ratam haberi, Dig. 41, 1, 9, 3. ‘Tradition is a natural mode of
acquisition, soritis a plain dictate of reason that the will of an
owner to transfer his ownership to another should be allowed to
take effect.’

Delivery sometimes precedes the intention to transfer, for in-
stance, in a conditional sale: in which case the transfer of property
is suspended until the condition is fulfilled.

The transferes· may be an incerta persona3 for instance, when
money is scattered among a mob by a praetor or consul (missilium
jactus), Inst. 2, 1, 46.

Herein Dominion (jus in rem) differs from Obligation (jus in
personam). When an Obligation is created, the payee or creditor
or person on whom a right is conferred, cannot be incerta persona 3
at least jurisprudence had not recognized an obligation or personal
right vested in incerta persona before the, invention of papers pay-
able to the holder or bearer: and here the admissibility of incerta
persona as creditor is effected by the introduction of jus in rem into
