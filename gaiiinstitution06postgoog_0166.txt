frequent allusions in the remainder of the treatise. 'Phis divergence
of the schools dates from the first elevation of the jurist to a species
of public functionary, namely, from the reign of Augustus, in
whose time, as we have seen, ᾗ 7, commentary, certain jurists
began to be investcd by imperial diploma with a quasi legislative
authority. In his reign the rival oracles were Antistius Labeo and
Caius Ateius Capito: Hi duo primum veluti diversas sectas fece-
runt, Dig. 1, 2, 47. ‘ The first founders of the two opposing sects.’
From Labeo’s works there are 63 extracts in the Digest, and
Labeo is cited as an authority in the extracts from other jurists
oftener than any one else except Salvius Julianus. From Sem-
pronius Proculus, a disciple of Labe0‚ andos whom 37 fragments
are preserved in the Digest, the school derived its name of Pro-
culiani. Other noted jurists of this school were Pegasus, in the
time of Vespasian 3 Celsus, in the time of Domitian, who gave
rise to the proverb, responsio Celsina, a discourteous answer, and
of whom 142 fragments are preserved3 and Neratius, of whom
64 fragments are preserved. To the other school belonged
Masurius Sabinus, who flourished under Ner0, and from whom
the sect were called Sabiniani. Sabinus is mentioned by Per·
sius :—

Vindicta postquam meus a praetore recessi,

Cur mihi non liceat jussit quodcunque voluntas,

Excepto si quid Masuri rubrica vetavit ?—5‚ 90.
‘ Touched by the enfranchising wand, I came my own master from
the praetor's court. What hinders me to follow the dictates of my
will, except where the Masurian rubric has forbidden ’.θ’ To the
same school belonged Caius Cassius Longinus, who flourished under
Nero and Vespasian, and from whom the sect are sometimes called
Cassiani: «Iavolenus Priscus, of whom 206 fragments are preserved:
Salvius Julianus, who reduced the praetorian edict to a permanent
form in the reign of Hadrian, and of whom 457 fragments are pre·
served: Pomponius, of whom 585 fragments are preserved: Sextus
Caecilius Africanus, celebrated for his obscurity, so that Africani
lex in the language of lawyers meant lex difficilis, of whom 131
fragments are preserved: and, lastly, our author, Gaius, who
flourished under Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius,
and from whose writings 535 extracts are to be found in the
Digest.

If we now inquire whether this divergence of schools was based
