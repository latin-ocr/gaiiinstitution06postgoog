ᾧ 44. A prejudicium is mentioned, 3 ᾗ 123, to try whether a
creditor had openly declared to the sureties the amount of the debt
and number of sureties; on which facts would depend the several
liabilities of each individual.

When Manus had fallen into desuetudo, Dos, the contribution of
the wife to the expenses of matrimony, became during the subsis-
tence of the marriage tie the property of the husband, 2 ᾗ 63, but
ceased to be his property at its termination. The law, how-
ever, by a partial nmmo-non of the dower allowed him to retain
whatever necessary outlay he had made for its conservation: Im·-
pensae neoessariae dotem ipso jure minuunt, Dig. 23, 2, 61. If, now,
we assume with Ihering that there was a period when every act-ion
was required to have an intentio certa, ᾧ 50, we can understand the
necessity of a praejudicium to ascertain quanta dos sit. For when
the divorced wife sued for restitution of her dower, having no
means of knowing the amount of her husband’s outlay upon it or
what portion of his outlay was necessary to its conservation, she
would certainly have incurred the penalties of plus petitio, ᾗ 53, if 0110
was not allowed to ascertain by a preliminary issue the amount of the
dower aster deduction of the necessary outlay. See ᾧ 115, 00111.

So when by the lex Falcidia all legacies were proportionally
abated until a fourth remained to the heir, it was necessary, in order
to enable the legatee to avoid plus petitio, to allow him to ascertain
the amount of the inheritance by a preliminary inquiry: Cum dicitur
lex Falcidia locum habere, arbiter dari solet ad ineundam quanti-
tatem bonorum‚ Dig. 35, 4, 1, 6. ‘ When Falcidia is alleged to be
applicable, an arbiter is appointed to ascertain the amount of the
inheritance.'

Could a Formula consist solely of a Demonstratio and a Con-
demnatio? Yes‚ if Savigny is right in supposing, ᾗ 312, that the
Praetor sometimes granted a Formula of the following sbape:

Quod Aulus Agerius juravit, Numerium Negidium fundum
Cornelianum ipsi dare oportere, quanti is fundus est, eum con·
demna. ‘ Whereas the plaintiff has sworn that the defendant owes
him such and such a thing, do thou, judex, condemn the defendant
to pay him its value.’

To explain this we must notice a peculiar use of the cath (jus-
jurandum) in Roman litigation.

The Teutonic tribes, including our ancestors, allowed a defendant
to purge himself by his own cath supported by the oath of a certain
