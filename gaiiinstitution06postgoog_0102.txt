libera permanere, sed servum ro-

senatusconsulto ratum esse iubetur.
sed postea divus Hadrianus iniqui-
tate τάφε-ιι anplgia„ ‚iuris inotus
restituit iuris gentium regulam, ut
cum ipsa mulier libera permaneat,
liberum pariat.

§85. Ex lege....eoeancillaet
libero poterant liberi nasci: nam
ea lege cavetur, ut si quis cum
aliena ancilla quam credebat libe-
ram esse coierit; si quidem mas-

ι culi nascantur, liberi sint, si vero

feminae, ad eum pertineant cuius
mater ancilla fuerit. sed et in hac
specie divus Vespasianus inelegantia
iuris motus restituit iuris gentium
regulam, ut omni modo, etiam si
masculi nascantur, servi sint eius
cuius et mater fuerit.

ξ 86. Sed illa pars eiusdem legis
salva est, ut ex libera et servo
alien0, quem sciebat servum esse,
servi nascantur. itaque apud quos
talis lex non est, qui nascitur iure
gentium matris condicionem sequi-

ξ 87. Quibus autem casibus ma-
tris et non patris condicionem se-
quitur qui nascitur, iisdem casibus
in potestate eum patris, etiamsi is
civis Romanus sit, non esse plus

sent, to continue herself in virtue
cf the convention free, while she
gave birth to a slave, her agree·
ment to that effect with the owner
being made valid by the senatus-
consult. Subsequently, however, the
late Emperor Hadrian was induced
by the injustice and anomaly of
the ordinance to re-establish the
rule of Gentile law, that as the
mother continues free the offspring
follows her status.

§ 85. By the (same) law the cff-
spring cf a female slave by a free-
man might be free, for that law
provided that the offspring of a
freeman by another person's female
slave whom he believed to be free
shall be free if they are male, but
shall belong to their mother’s pro·
prietor if they are female: but here
too the late Emperor Vespasian was
moved by the anomalous character
of the rule to re-establish the canon
os Gentile law, and declared that
the offspring in every case, whether
male or female, should be slaves
and the property of their mother's
owner.

ξ 86. Βιιι another clause of that
law continues in force, providing
that the offspring of a freewoman
by another person's slave whom she
kncws to be a slave are born slaves,
though where this law is not estab-
lished the offspring by Gentile law
follow the mother’s condition and
are free.

ξ 87. When the child follows the
mother's condition instead of the
father's, it is obvious that he is not
subject to the power of the father,
even though the father is aRoman
citizen: but in some cases, as Ι
mentioned above (ξ 67),- when a
mistake was the occasion cf a non·
civil marriage being contracted, the
senate interferes and purges the
defect of the marriage, and this
