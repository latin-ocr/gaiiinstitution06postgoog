we have seen that, in the absence of patria, a man's personal
capacity was determined by his domicilium. We may infer that
the equivalence of domicilium to patria—to say nothing of the
modern maxim: Locus regit actum, 4 ξ 53, com., the ability of even
temporary residence, as opposed to domicil, to give validity to the
mere Form of a disposition—was not completely established, not at
all events in favour of Dediticius, in the times of Gaius or even in
those of Ulpian.

ξ 76. The third class of freedmanship (dedititia. libertas) had long
been obsolete when it was formally abolished by J ustinian, Aa). 530, '
Cod. 7, 5.

The second class (latinitas), under which the freedman relapsed
into servitude at the moment of death, was also offensive to Roman
feelings in the time of J ustinian, and was by him formally abolished,
the principal modes of creating latinitas being transformed into
modes of acquiring quiritary status or civitas Romana, and the
remainder being declal'ed inoperative, Cod. 7, 6.

The rules of succession to intestate froedmen of the first class,

agnation or the civil family: deprived patrous of their right of
succession concurrently with the children of opulent freedmen;
that is, reduced them to the rank of agnatos, where they had been
placed by the Twelve Tables, from that of sui heredes, to which
they had been virtually promoted by subsequent legislation: and
changed the remaining series of titles by patronage as defined by
the praetorian edict in default of patrons and their children.

The praetorian edict had contained the following series of titles

to bonorum possessio, or classes of successore to the estate of
intestata freedmen:

(1) Unde liberi. The children of the deceased, whether under

power, or emancipated, or given in adoption, had the first and
highest title to succeed to the estate of their father.

(2) Unde legitimi. Patrona and their children occupy the second 1
rank. As a frcedman could have no agnates or cognates (agnation
