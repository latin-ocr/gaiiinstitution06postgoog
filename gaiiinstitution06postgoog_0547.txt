person in his power whom he had authorized to trade, the condem-
nation was limited to the amount of the peculium (quatenus in
peculio est); if the slave or son had traded without authority, it
was limited to the amount of profit the father 01 master had
thereby received (quatenus in rem ejus versum est); if the heir of
a wrong-doer or fraudulent debtor was sued, it was limited to the

amount that he gained from the wrong or fraud by his succession
(dumtaxat in id quod ad eum pervenit).

Again some debtors enjoyed a privilege that is called Beneficium ·.

competentiae: the privilege of not being condemned to pay the
whole amount of their debt but only such an amount as will leave
them the means of subsistence (condemnatio in id quod debitor
facere potest). A soldier sued by any creditors; a bankrupt who
has made cessio bonorum, sued by his original creditors in respect of
after-acquired property3 a paterfamilias 811011 by a creditor for a
debt incurred when he was a filiusfamilias3 an ascendant sued
by a descendant3 a husband sued by a wife or a wife by a
husband before or aster divorce for a debt incurred during mar—
riage; a father-in-law sued by a son-in-law for 8 promised dower;
a donor sued by a donee; 8 partner sued by a partner3 were only
liable to be condemned in such a sum as would leave them the
necessaries of life. 'Phe privilege was enforced by Exceptio [?],
Dig. 44, 1, 22. It was forfeited by dolus and did not apply to
liabilities arising from delict. If 8 privileged debtor was con-
demned in the whole amount of his fortune he could claim to have
a deduction for his means cf subsistence made in the levy of
execution.

'Phe obligation of the privileged debtor, however, was not extin-
guished until his creditor had received full satisfaction‚ and any
after-acquired property of the debtor was liable to the claims of the
creditor. Accordingly, at the period when Res judicata operated
either ipso jure or per exceptionem to extinguish a right of action,
3 ξ 180, 11 was necessary, in order to preserve the creditor's right
of subsequent action for the residue, that the judge, as a condition
of allowing the Beneficium competentiae, should compel the debtor
to enter into a stipulation 011 which a subsequent suit could be
grounded. At a later period, when Res judicata had lost its power
of necessary Novation, it was no longer requisite 10 exact this
cautio from the debtor before he was allowed to enjoy the Bene-
ficium competentiae. Vangerow‚ ᾗ 1⁷4.
