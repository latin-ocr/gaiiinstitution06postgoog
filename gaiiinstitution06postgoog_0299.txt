(exceptio) whereby the valid claim of the lega‘oee might be
counteraeted. 4 ξ 115, com.

Assuming that the lex Furia de sponsu and the lex Furia tes-
tamentaria were two clauses of the same enactment, the lex Furia
has had the singular destiny of having provoked ΒΥ antagonism
the introduction of two new institutions in Roman jurisprudence.
The desire of evading its penalties relating to sponsio probably
was the origin of fidejussi03 and the desire of evading its penalties
relating to legata was probably a principal stimulus to the in-
vention of fideicommissa. Iliering. ⁶

The exceptae personae of the lex Furia testamentaria were the ³ ,ᾖ ·’
cognates of that ascendent by whom the testator, when filius'- ⁶ '²

familiaS, had been emancipated‚ Ulpian, 28, 7.

ᾧ 226’ The lex Voconi& S¹¹PP0¹³⁴0d 1³0 have been passed by the m„

tribune Quintus Voconius Saxa, 169 Β.υ., contained a provision
to the effect that a woman could not be instituted heiress to a
classicus, or person scheduled in the first class of the census,
i. e. registered as owner of property to the amount of a hundred
thousand sesterces and upward, 2 ᾤ 2743 and another, mentioned
in the text, whereby the utmost amount that any one, male or
female, could take as legates, would be limited to half the value of
the inheritance. This disposition of the lex Voconia was probably
the origin of the form of legacy called partitio, 2 ξ 254, whereby
a testator boqueathed as legacy an aliquot part of his inheritance.
A testator with one heres would leave to a female legatee one half,
with two heredes one third, of the inheritance, aud so on, if hc
wished to leave her the-utmost the law permitted.

The result of the lex Voconia, coupled with the rules of preter-
mission and intestacy, is the following: a daughter might take half
her father's estate either as legatee (partiaria, 2 ᾤ 254) or, if preter-
mitted (praeterita), as heiresS‚ 2 ᾦ 124. If she was filia unica, she
might take the whole estate as heiress, if her father died intestato:
but Romans were very averse to dying intestate3 and in this event

she would not have the free disposition of her property, as she ‘1¹35 μ.- ,

would be the ward of her agnates.

ᾗ 227. The terms of the principal clause of the lex Falcidia,
passed Β. ο. 40, are given in the Digest: Quicunque civis Romanus
post hanc legem rogatam testamentum faciet, is quantam cuique
,civi Romano pecuniam jure publico dare legare volet, jus potestas-
que est0, dum ita detur legatum, ne minus quam partem quartam
