before. 'Hie formula of law begins
by defining the ground of action in
the Demonstratio, and then appeals
to the law in these terme: ‘What-
ever the defendant ought therefore
to convey or perform! The formula
of fact commences with an Intentio
defining the ground of action, thus:
‘ If it 116 proved that such 8 plaintiff
deposited such a thing with such 8
defendant! Certainly in the latter
case, that is, in 8 formula of fact, if
the plaintiff asserts t-hat he deposit-
ed more than he really deposited, he

ἕ 53. When the Forum or court in which an action on a contract ·
16 brought happened to differ from the place specified in the con-
tract as the place where a certain act (payment, delivery, convey-
auce, &c.) was to be performed, if the contract was such 86 naturally
to ground a Condictio (actio stricti juris), in order to avoid the
fault of Plus petitio, which would be fatal to the present claim and
to any subsequent claim on the same contract, it was necessary to
sue, not by a Condictio which would be the proper form if the
action were brought at the stipulated place of performance, but by
formula Arbitraria. A defendant who lost an action was bound to
make payment at the forum where the action was brought: ibi
erit praestandum ubi petitur, Dig. 30, 47, 1. In an actio Arbitraria
the judge could consider the difference of place and meet the de-
mands of equity by increasing or diminishing the amount which
his arbitratus required the defendant to pay in order to avoid con-
demnatio. If the contract were such as to give rise to a Bona fide
actio, it would not be necessary to sue by formula Arbitraria in
order to avoid Plus petitio, for the judex of 811 86116 Ex 116118 fide
had more discretion than the judex of a Condictio and by the
wording of his commission‚ Ex fide 116118, could allow for the dif-
ference of place if performance were enforced at a place different
from that specified in the contract.

'I'o understand the foregoing we must consider the various tri-
bunals before which an action ean be instituted: at what forum or
before what judge a plaintiff 6811 6116 8 defendant.
