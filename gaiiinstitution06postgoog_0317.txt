(8) If the heres has to transfer the whole but has reeeived his
Falcidian fourth in the shape of legacieS‚ the transferree has to
satisfy the legatees: and if he cannot pay the whole of their legacies
they may recover from the· heres all that he receives beyond his

fourth. -

(9) If the heir is directed to transfer not the whole but ξ- of the
inheritance, the transferree has to satisfy the legatesS, but deducts
and retains for himself {- of their legacies, as he would under the

circumstances supposed in No. 3.

DE. SINGULIS REBUS PER. mnmcomssun Immone.

ξ 260. Potest autem quisque etiam
res singulas per fideicommissum re-
linquere, velut fundum, hominem,
vestem, argentum, pecuniam3 et vel
ipsum heredem rogare, ut alicui re-
stituat, vel legatarium, quamvis a
legatario legari non possit.

§261. Item potest non solum pro-
pria testatoris res per fideicommis-
sum relinqui, sed etiam heredis aut
legatarii aut cuiuslibet alterius.
itaque et legatarius non solum de
ea re rogari potest, ut eam alicui
restituat, quae ei legata sit, sed etiam
de alia, sive ipsius legatarii sive
aliena sit. sed hoe solum obser-
vandum est, ne plus quisquam ro-
getur alicui restituere, quam ipse
ex testamento ceperit: nam quod
amplius est inutiliter relinquitur.

ξ 262. Cum autem aliena res per
fideicommissum relinquitur, necesse
est ei qui rogatus est, aut ipsam
redimere et praestare, aut aestima-
tionem εἰπε solvere. sicut iuris est,
si per damnationem aliena res legata
sit. sunt tamen qui putant, si rem
per fideicommissum relictam domi-
nus non vendat, extingui fideicom-
missum: sed aliam esse oausam per
damnationem legati.

ξ 263. Libertas quoque servo per
fideicommissum dari potest, ut vel
heres rogetur manumittere, vel le-
gatarius.

5260. Not only aggregates of
right, but single rights, may be left
in trust, as property in land, in a
slave, in a gar-ment, in plats, in
money; and the trust may be im-
posed either on an heir or on a
legatee, although a legatee cannot
be charged with a legacy.

§261. Not only the testator's
property, but that of an heir, or
legatee, or strzmger, may be left in
trust. Thus a legatee may be
charged with a trust to transfer
either a thing bequeathed to him,
or any other thing belonging to
himself or to a stranger; provided
always that he is not charged with
a trust to transfer more than he
takes under the will, for in raepeet
of such excess the trust would be
void.

ξ 262. When a stranger’s pro-
perty is left by trust, the trustes
must either procure and convey the
ῗῗιὲἓίἶέ ῒῖἶζῖἕ ἓζέξέᾶὴὲηέἰῖῗῗὶέῒ
quest by condemnation3 though
some hold that the owner’s refusal
to sell avoids a trust to convey
while it does not avoid a bequest
by condemnation.

§263. Liber-ty can be left to a
slave by a trust charging either an
heir· or a legates with his manu·
mission.
