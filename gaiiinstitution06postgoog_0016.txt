 

x PREFACE

Law or jus civile or jus strictum. In the present edition it is
regarded, in aeeordanee with the exposition of Savigny, as a defenee
alleging a collision between the right of the plaintiff and a eounter
right of the defendanb, as opposed to a defenee denying the right
of the plaintiff: and, wherever significant expressions have been
attempbed, tho translation has been correspondingly modified.

Legis aetio, the technieal name of the primitive mode of pro-
cedure, as presenting a eontrast both to an earlier system of violent
sels-redtess and to a later sysfiem (marked by diminished jealousy
of the magistrate) of magisterial interposition and magistet-iel
discretion, has been invariably rendered by the term Statute-

proeeoe.
