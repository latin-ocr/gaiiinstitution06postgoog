ιν. ξς 138-170.] PosssssmN. . 641

Possession may be defined as a relation which consiste of two
elementa ς Detention, or physical power over a thing, and Animus
domini, a certain intention on the part of the detainer, the intention
of holding it as proprietor, of deriving from it the benefits of
ownership. Theophilus, the colleague of Tribonian and author of
the Greek version of J ustinian’s InstituteS, says: νέμεσθαί ἐστι τὸ
ψυχῇ δεσπόζοντος κατέχειν, 3, 39, 2. The meaning· of this definition
will best appear from an examination of the instances in which
according to the jurists Possession does or does not exist3 and in
particular from the contrast of the cases where Possession is pre-
sent with those where Detention is present but Possession absent.

Possession, as opposed to Detention, is called Possessio civilis, or
simply PossessiO, or juristic possession.

Mere Detention is called Custodia, In possessione esse, Possessio
naturalis,

The characteristic of possessio civilis is the combination of De-
tentio with the Animus domini: but in certain singular or ab·
normal instances we shall find that this differentia is wanting,
and detention in the name of another owner (alieno nomine),
i.e. possessio naturaliS, is treated as if it were juristic possession:

Possession, accompanied with certain other extraneous conditions,
namely Titulus and Bona fides, is transformed by a certain lapse
of time into dominion3 and is called Usucapion-possession. Our
present purpose is with Possession apart from these foreign ele-
ments: the Possession which, as protected by Utrubi, Uti possidetiS,
and Unde vi, is often called Interdict-possession.

'Phe slave and filiusfamilias had no possession. Quod ex justa
causa corporaliter a servo tenetur id in peculio servi est, et pecu-
lium quod servus civiliter quidem possidere non potest sed natu-
raliter tenet, dominus creditur possidere, Dig. 41, 2, 24. ‘When
a slave has detention on just grounds, the thing is in his peculium,
and his master has possession.' Qui in aliena potestate sunt, rem
peculiarem tenere possunt, habere et possidere non possunt, quia
possessio non tantum corporis sed et juris est, Dig. 41, 2 3 49, 1.
‘ A person under power has detention of a peculium but not posses-
sion, for the conditions of possession are not purely physical, but
partly legal.’ We must except the peculium castrense and quasi-
castrense. Filiusfamilias in castris adquisitum usucapiet, Dig. 41,
3, 4, 1. ‘ What a filiusfamilias acquires in the field is converted by
possession into property.’
