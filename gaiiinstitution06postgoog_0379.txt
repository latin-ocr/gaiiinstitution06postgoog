whether a Primordial right, a right of Status, or a right of Do-
minion. These duties are mainly negative, duties of forbearance
or abstention3 whereas Obligations in the narrower sense, the sense
in which the word is used by the classical jurists‚ are mainly
pesitive, duties of action or performance. The former, that is,
negative obligatione, obligations correlative to jus in rem, have
scarcely received a distinctive appellation in the Latin language:
for the sake of distinction from moral duties they may be called
Necessitas, and for the sake of distinction from Positive dutiae,
Necessitas abstinendi.

J ustinian defines Obligation as follows: Obligatio est juris vin-
culum quo necessitate astringimur alicujus solvendae rei secundum
nostrae civitatis jura, Inst. 3, 13. ‘ Obligation is a legal bond, that
is, the being compelled to some performance by the law of the state
(power of the sovereign).'

Having formerly divided Obligations into Primary and Secondary‚
we may inquire which of these classes is more directly contemplated
in this definition. Apparently the class of Secondary obligations:
at least the definition is not applicable to all cases of Primary
obligation. In Obligations ex contractu the necessitas both of the
Primary and the Secondary obligation is a necessitas solvendi:
in Obligation ex delicto while the necessitas of the Secondary
obligation is necessitas solvendi3 the necessitas of the Primary
obligation (there is no Obligation in the classical sense of the term)
is not necessitas solvendi but necessitas abstinendi.

'Phe performance (solutio) of which the law imposes a necessity
when it imposes an obligation is sometimes decomposed into three
elements, expressed by three terme, datio, facti0, praestatio. In
personam actio est quotiens cum aliquo agimus qui nobis ex
contractu vel ex delicto obligatus est, id est, cum intendimus dare, .
facere, praestare oportere, 4 ᾧ 2. ‘ A personal action pursues an f
obligation arising from contract or delict, and declares that the
defendant is bound to convey, perform, or indemnify.’ Obliga-
tionum substantia non in eo consistit ut aliquod corpus nostrum
aut servitutem nostram faciat, sed ut alium nobis obstringat ad
dandum aliquid vel faciendum vel praestandum, Dig. 44, 7, 3.
‘ An obligation does not subject a thing corporeal “ οι· incorporeal
to our dominion, but compels a person to convey some dominion,
or render some service, or repair some loss.’ Datio denotes the
transfer of quiritarian dominion in a certain thing ,or sum of
