When two things belonging to different owners are mixed
but neither produce a new species (confusio), nor the relation of
principal and accessory, e. g. when two similar wines or metals are
mixed; or when a new species is produced with the consent of both
owners, as when mead is produced by mixing honey and wine,
electrum by mixing gold and silver3 then each owner loses his
separate ownership of a part, and becomes joint owner of the
whole.

When a new species is produced by one owner without the con-
sent of the other, then the exclusive ownership is vested in the
producer, and the other can only obtain redress for the expro-
priation or loss of his ownership.

Fui-ther, when the mixture establishes the relation of principal
and accessory, that is, when one thing loses its independent ex·
istence and becomes a part of the other (accessio), then the property
in the whole is vested in the proprietor of the dominant part 3
e. g. the property in the ship follows the property in the keel,
proprietas totius navis carinae causam sequitur, Dig. 6, 1, 61.
It will sometimes be a question which part is to be regarded as
principal and which as accessory, and the solution does not always
depend on their comparative valuefl Sometimes the relation of sub-
stance and accident prevails, for instance, in a tapestry the property
in the embroidery follows the property in the wool. Sometimes the
comparative value decides; sor instance, the property in the canvas
follows the property in the painting: and this seems more rational,
though Gaius appears to think that a picture ought to be governed
by the analogy of a manuscript, where the property in the writing
follows the property in the paper.

ᾗ 78. The remedy of the ex-proprietor of the accessory is an
in factum actio (4 ᾧ 46), Dig. 6, 1, 33, 5. Ulpian, Dig. 6, 1, 5, 3,
speaks of a real action (utilis in rem actio), which, as a real action
implies that the plaintiff is proprietor, seems to mean a Fiet-itione
action, 4 ᾧ 34, i. e. one whose formula feigns that the property was
never devested by Accession. This may be what Gaius means by
utilis actio.

579. Specification or labour is a title which cannot without
violence be brought under either Occupatio or Accessio. Here
one person contributes only his labour, whereby he transforma

the material or materials belonging to another into a new product
(nova species). The Sabinians held that the product belonged (by
