nem facere mulier non solum cum
marito suo, sed etiam cum extraneo:
unde aut matrimonii causa facta
coemptio dicitur, aut fiduciae-n causa.
quae enim eum marito suo facit
coemptionem, ut aput eum filiae
loco sit, dicitur matrimonii causa
fecisse coemptionem: quae vero al-
terius rei causa facit coemptionem
eum viro suo aut cum extraneo,
velut tutelae evitandae causa, dici-
tur fiduciae causa fecisse coemp-
tionem.

§ 115. Quod est tale: si qua velit
quos habet tutores reponere, ut
alium nanciscatur, iis auctoribus
coemptionem facit; deinde a co-
emptionatore remancipata ei cui
ipsa velit, et ab eo vindicta manu-
'' missa, incipit eum habere tutorem,
a quo manumissa est: qui tutor
fiduciarius dicitur, sicut inferius ap-
parebit.

§ 115 a. Olim etiam testamenti
faciendi gratia fiduciaria fiebat
coemptio. tunc enim non aliter
feminae testamenti faciendi ius ha—

tionis faciendae ex auctoritate divi

§115 b. Licet autem mulier fidu-
ciae causa eum viro suo fecerit oo-
emptionem, nihilominus filiae loco

bet ex causa uxor in manu viri sit,
placuit eam ἑυνα filiae nancisci.

DE PERSONIS.

[1. ἕξ 108-115 b.

may convey herself either to a hus-
band or to a stranger, and accord-
ingly there are two forms of coemp-
tion, matrimonia] and fiduciary. A
coemption with a husband in order
to acquire the status of daughter in
his house is a matrimonial coemp-
tion: a coemption for another pur-
pose, whether with a husband or
with a stranger, for liberation, for

instance, from guardianship, is a
fiduciary coemption.

ξ 115. This is accomplished by
the following process: the woman
who desires to set aside her present
guardians and substitute another
makes a coemption of herself to
some one with their sanction:
thereupon the party to this coemp-
tion remancipates her to the person
intended to be substituted as guar-
dian, and this person manumits her
by fictitious vindication, and in
virtue of this manumission becomes
her guardian, being called a fidu-
ciary guardian, as will hereafter be
explained.

ξ 115 α. Ιιι former times testa-
mentary capacity was acquired by
fiduciary coemption, for no woman
was competent to dispone of her
property by will, with the exeep-
tion of certain persons, unless she
had made a coemption, been reman-
cipated, and then manumitted: but
this necessity of coemption was
abolished by a senatusconsult made
on the motion of Hadrian.

ξ 115 b. Even if a woman makes
only a fiduciary coemption with her
husband, she acquires the status of
his daughter, for it is held that
from whatever cause a woman is in

the hand of her husband, she ac-
quires the position of his daughter.

Marital power (manus) was entirely assimilated to patria potestas.
By manus the husband had power of life and death over the wife,
