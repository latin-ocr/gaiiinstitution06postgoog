564 DE AOTIONIBUS. [ιν. §§ 88-102.

right to security in a real action for a servitude as well as for a cor-
poral thing, and therefore, analogous to the interdict‚ Quem fundum,
there is an interdict, Quem usumfructum, for the transfer of a
usufruct.' Quoties hereditas petitur, satisdatio jure desideratur-3 et
si satisdatio non detur, in petitorem hereditas transfertur. Si
petitor satisdare noluerit, penes possessorem possessio remanet3
in pari enim eausa potior est possessor, Paulus, Receptae Sen-
tentiae, 1, 11, 1. ‘In a demand of a heritage, security must
be given, or else possession is transferred to the demandant.
If the demandant refuse to give security‚ possession remains
with the tenant, for in equal circumstances law favours the pos-
sessor.²

'Phe same rule applied to Praedial servitudeS. If A asserted
against B the Urban servitude altius Non tollendi (si ageretur, jus
vicino non esse, aedes altius tollere), i. e. sought by aetio Confessoria
of jus altius Non tollendi (with an intenti0, perhaps, in the following·
form: Si paret jus Numerio Negidio non esse aedes altius tollendi
invito Aulo Agerio) to restrain B from exercising the indefinite
powers of ownership by raising the height of his house, B might
decline ‘to defend the aetion and thus avoid a judicial decision as
to the existence of the servitude: but as a penalty for this he
was not allowed afterwards to exercise his alleged right without
first proving before a tribunal the nullity of A's claime proving,
that is, either that A never had such a servitude over the house of
B, or that B had extinguished it by acquisition of the counter-
servitude (libertatis usucapio). That is to say, being originally
in possession, or rather quasi-possession of his right (for servitudes
are subjecte of quasi-possession), B was put out of possession3
and, if he afterwards wished to exercise his right of builffing, had
first to recover possession of it as plaintiff in a suit: i. e. by actio
Negatoria of jus Non altius tollendi, if he denied that A as do-
minans ever enjoyed such a servitude, or by actio Confessoria of
jus altius tollendi if he claimed as serviens to have reacquired the
freedom of his house by usucapio libertatis (in either case, perhaps,
with an intentio in the following form: Si paret jus Aulo Agerio
esse aedes altius tollendi invito Numerio Negidio).

'I'he penalty would only consist in an inversion of the order of
proof: B as plaintiff would have to prove his own proprietorship
before A as defendant was put to prove the existence of the servi-
tude: whereas, if A had been plaintiff, A would have bad to begin
