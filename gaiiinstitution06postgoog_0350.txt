DE: Bolus LIBERTORUM LATINORUM.

ξ 55. Sequitur ut de bonis La-
tinorum libertinorum dispiciamus.

§ 56. Quae pars iuris ut mani-
festior fiat, admonendi: sumus, de
quo alio loco diximus, eos qui nunc
Latini Iuniani dicuntur olim ex iure
Quiritium servos fuisse, sed auxilio
Praetoris in libertatis forma servari
solitos 3 unde etiam res eorum pecu·
lii iure ad patronos pertinere solita
est: postea vero per legem Iuniam
eos omnes *quos Praetor in liberta-
tem tuebatur liberos esse coepisse
et appellatos esse Latinos Iunianos:
Latinos ideo, quia lex eos liberos
perinde esse voluit, atque si essent
cives Romani ingenui qui ex urbe
Roma in Latinas colonias deducti
Latini coloniarii esse coeperunt:
Iunianos ideo, quia per legem Iu-
niam liberi facti sunt, etiamsi non
cives Romani. quare legis Iuniae
lator, cum intellegeret futurum, ut
ea fictione res Latinorum defunc·
torum ad patronos pertinere desi-
nerent, ob id quod neque ut servi
decederent, ut possent iure peculii
res eorum ad patronos pertinere,
neque liberti Latini hominis bona
possent manumissionis iure ad pa-
tronos pertinere, necessarium eccis-
timavit, ne beneficium istis datum
1n iniuriam patronorum convertere-
tur, cavere‚ ut bona horum liberto·
rum proinde ad manumissores per·
tinerent, ac si lex lata non esset.
itaque iure quodammodo peculii
bona Latinorum ad manumissores
eorum pertinent.

ξ 55. We proceed to the succes-
sions of Latini J uniani.

ξ 56. To understand this branch
of law we must recollect what has
been already mentioned (1 522),
that those who are called Latini
J uniani were originally slaves by
law of the Quirites, though main-
tained by the praetor‘s protection
in a condition of quasi freedom, so
that their possessione belonged to
their patrons by the title of pecu-
lium. At a more recent period
Ra). 19], when the lex J unia Nor-

na was enacted, those whom the
praetor had protected in quasi free-
dom became legally free, and were
called Latini Juniani: Latini, be-
cause the law assimilated their free-
dom to that of freeborn citizens of
Rome who, on quitting Rome for a
Latin colony, became Latin colo-
nists; J miani, because the lex J unia
gave them liberty without citizen-
ship: and as the author of the lex
J unia foresaw that the effect of this
fiction would be that the goods of
deceased Latini J uniani would cease
to belong to the patron, as they
would not be slaves at the time of
their death, so that their goods
should belong to the patron by the
title of peculium, and they would
not devolve to him by title of ma-
numission 3 he deemed it necessary,
to prevent the favour to these
freedmen from becoming a wrong
to the patron, to provide that their
goods should belong to the manu-
mitter in the same way as if the
law had not been enacted. Con·
sequently the goods of Latini J u·
niani belong to their manumittere
by the title of quasi peculium.
