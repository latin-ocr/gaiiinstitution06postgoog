382 DE OBLIGA'I'IONIBUS. [111. ξς 97-109.

ᾧ 9¹7. A stipulation was inutilis, i. e. originally (ipso jure) null and
void, which conferred no right on the promissee even though the
promissor alleged no counter right (exceptio). When this was
clear, thc praetor would not permit the promissae to sue (actionem
denegare), Dig. 45, l, 2⁷. A penal clause would generally (see
note to ξ 103 for an exception) give no validity to a stipulation

· ἐ otherwise void. Si homo mortuus sisti non potest, nec poena rei

impossibilis committetur, quemadmodum si quis Stichum mortuum
dari stipulatus, si datus non esset, poenam stipularetur, Dig. 45, 1,
69. ‘ A slave deceased cannot be produced, and a penal sum an-
nexed to the breach of an impossible condition, for instance, the
conveyance of a deceased slave, is not forfeited.’

Among the objects that could not be secured by stipulation, and
still less by any Formless contract, are Dispositions under the code
of Family law (the laws governing domestic relations) or the code
of Succession. Ε. g. no promise of marriage (sponsalia) was legally
binding—a striking contrast to the rule of English law. Nor do
we hear of any binding agreement to a future Emancipation, Adop-
tion, or Arrogation3 or for the principal acts relating to the law
of Succession, to the execution of a Will or to the aditio of an in-
heritance. In all these solemn Dispositions the Roman legislator
deemed it expedient that the disposer should have an entire free-
dom of choice at the moment of making the Disposition.

ξ 98. This seems an appropriate place for the following remarks
on the general nature of condition& A Condition is an clement
of 'I'itle3 it is a certain contingent occurrence or non-occurrence,
performance or non-performance, by arbitrary appointment con-
ferring on a certain person a certain right, or imposing on him
a certain obligation. It may be defined as the middle term (B)
of a syllogism of which the minor term (C) represents a person,
and the major term (A) a right or obligation, and of which both
the premisses are Contingent. It is the last feature that we shall
first proceed to consider.

The major premiss must be contingent3 it must be an arbitrary
determination that makes the right or obligation (A) depend on the
given title (B); the nexus between the middle and major terms
must be solely the will of the testator or contractors, not the will
of the legislator; the title must not be in its own nature the Neces-
sary presupposition of the right. Ε. g. in the following cases: the
institution of a person as heir, {f he mwive the testator, if be accept
