continued bona fides. Savigny, ξ 244. 'Phe effect of this seems
to be to abolish prescription as opposed to usucapion as far as real
action (vindicatio) is concerned3 for bona fides coupled with thirty
years' possession would make the possessor proprietor.
'Phe civil law, however, in respect of Dominion, recognized pre-
scription as distinct from usucapion. Let us consider what was the
case in respect of QffitqdeS.
There was originally, as we have already stated, usucapion either
for all servitudes or at least urban servitudeS, until it was abol-
ξ ished by the lex Scribonia. The jurists, however, and praetors
ἶ recognized an acquisition of servitudes by Diuturnus usus, Longa
consuetudo, Longa quasi possessi0, of ten years inter praesentes or
twenty years inter absentes· This required neither justus titulus
nor bona fides (and therefore is never called longi temporis prae-
(scriptio) but only freedom from the three vices of possession: it
must be nec vi, nec clam, nec ‘precario Dig. 8, 5, 19, pr. Whether
any acquisition of servitudes on less stringent terms, corresponding
to longissimi temporis praescriptio m the case of dominion, was ever p
recognized is not certain: Vangerow, ᾧ 351, supposes the contrary. 1
The extinction of persona! and rural servitudes was produced m 1
the times before J ustrman by continual non· usus during one „year ἶ
in the case of movableS, during two in the case of iinmovableS.
J nstlman extended the period to ten years inter praesentes and
twenty years inter absentes, Cod. 3, 34, 13. No bona fides on the
part of serviens is required. If- the exercise of the servitude was
discontinuous (limited to certain seasonS, or alternate months, διο.)
before Justinian the period required for extinction was doubled: ζ
J ustlman required in every case twenty yearS, Cod. 3, 34, 14, pr. ᾖ
Urban servitudes are extinguishcd not by mere non· usus on the ³
part of dominans but by additional usucapio libertatis on the part
of serviens, i. e. by possession of the servient tenement in such a
condition that the servitude could not be exercised. Such is the
state of the servient tenement ιιι servitus tigni immittendi when no
beam is inserted and the hole where it might be inserted is built
⁴ up: or when, in the servitus ne luminibus officiatur, dominans has
built up his window and in front of it serviens has erected a wall.
The same period is required as for extinction by non-usus: the
same absence of violence, secrecy, permission (and, by the canon

law, the same bona fides) as for the acquisition of other servitudes.
