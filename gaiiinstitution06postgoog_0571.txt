inducebatur, Inst. 4, 6, 30. The same exceptio was doubtless ne-
cessary even in an action ex bona fide when the counterclaim
arose from an independent transaction (ex alia causa).

The exception was of the form: Si in ea re nihil dolo malo Auli
Agerii factum sit neque fiat, 4 ᾧ 119: and we find in the Digest a
definition of Dolus that seems intended to ‚apply to a claim for

Compensation: Dolo facit qui petit quod redditurus est, Dig.
44, 4, 8.

 

Some writers hold that this exceptio empowered the judex, not (Ἴ &2222-

to make compensation but to give judgment against the plaintiff
on the ground of Plus petiti03 and they explain that this was not
so iniquitous as at ‘first sight it may appear, as the loss of the action
would only be a penalty to the plaintiff for refusing to employ a
formula containing a Compensatio or Deductio, the usage of these
formulae being in effect generalized by the rescript of Marcus
Aureliae.

Vangerow, on the other hand, observes that we have no evi-
dence that an intentio modified by a Compensatio or Deductio was
ever employed by any plaintiff but the Ar ntarius and Bonorum
emptor: while we are expressly informed y Theophilus 4, 6, 30,
that the effect of Exceptio doli was to diminish the condemnati03
which again is consistent with what is said of the general nature of
exceptio: Exceptio est conditio quae modo eximit reum condem-
nationi, modo minuit damnationem, Dig. 44, 1, 22.

As Gaius flourished under Marcus Aurelius, and makes no men-
tion of his rescript, we must infer that it either was issued after
the publication of these Institutione, or was mentioned in the pre-
ceding paragraphs where the manuscript is now defective.

J ustinian extended Compensation to Real actions, cod. 4, 31, 14.

ξ 66. The balance for which the banker sued was not the balance
of a Personal account, but the balance of one of the Real accounts
for corn, wine, oil, &c., into which the debtor’s total personal account
was subdivided. The law courts, that is, took notice of the cus-
tomary practice of the book-keepers, and a question naturally
arose as to the extent to which a personal account could be sub-
divided.

§ 68. It was the duty of the Argentarius to keep the accounts of
his customers: whereas the Bonorum emptor might well be ignorant
of the transactione of the insolvent. This explains the greater
rigour with which the Argentarius was treated.
