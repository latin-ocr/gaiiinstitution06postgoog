111. §§ 55-76.] MUNIOIPIA. 335

At the close of the republic, and during the first centuries of the
empire, all Italy, with the exception of Rome, was composed of a
number of townships ; each with its own territorial limits, and each
possessed of its own constitution, magistrates, jurisdiction, and, to a
certain extent, legislation. In the lex J ulia municipalis, preserved
on the tabula Heracleensis, these townships are called Coloniae when
they had been founded as colonies from Rome, Municipia when they
traced their existence to some other origin. The Provinces, though
originally very variously constituted, were gradually assimilated in
condition 19 Italy and its towns: so that finally the whole empire
was composed of municipalium, and almost all of its free inhabitants
were either citizens of Rome or of some local and inferior com-
munity.

The generic denomination of these communities, whether Italian
or Provincial, was Civitas or Respublica. The term Municipium
was sometimes used in this generic sense3 but was more commonly
used in a specific sense as opposed to Colonia. Municipes, however, 19
often used in the generic sense where we might have expected Muni-
cipium3 as equivalent to Respublica or Civitas. It is also often used to
signify generically, not a state or juristic person (municipium), but
its individual members ς 1. 9. as equivalent to cives, in speaking of
any town but Rome: as the word Civis, from its habitual opposi-

, 11911 19 Latinus and Peregrinus, had acquired a tendency to suggest
civis Romanus. The area belonging to each town was called Regio
or Territorium, and included under one jurisdiction all the Vici
within its geographical 11111119. ,

Citizenship (civitas, patria, origo) in any municipality was pro- 1
ducible by four causes: Municipem aut nativitas facit, aut manu· ³2
missio, aut adoptio, D. 50, l, 30, pr. Cives quidem origo, manu· ⁷-
missio, allectio, vel adoptio ς 11199199 vero domicilium facit, C. 10, '
39, 7.

(1) Birth (origo, nativitas) was the commonest title3 and hence
the word origo 19 used as equivalent to civitas. Legitimate children
had the civitas of their sethei-3 illegitimate of their mother.
Some states had the privilege that legitimate children should have
the civitas of the mother in addition to that of the father.

(2) Adoptio gave to the adopted child, in addition to his original 1
civitas, that of his adoptive father.

(3) Manumissio, when perfect, gave to 1119 freedman the civitas
of his patronus.
