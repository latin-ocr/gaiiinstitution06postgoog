'l'he terma, Grues and sught, like other qmtitative terme, have
no positive signification until we fix upon come unit of mensure-

frequently employed by the Roman jai-ista. the exn-aordinary

individual habitually bestows on hia own intercute. Although
there is no necessary antithesis between these two standai-(1⁵,
yet practieally in Roman law they serve to fix the meaning of
grues and slight negligenee. Slight negligence is the absence of
the extraordinary diligence of the most eareful man of businesc;
grone negligence is the absence of the degree os diligenoe which
a man habitually bestowe on his own eoneerns. The degree of
diligence for which a man is held responsible depende on various
principles, which may best be indicated by the following state- ·
ment of the degreee of diligenee exacted or of negligenee imputed
in the principal contracte and quasi-contracte.

Extraordinary eure is required of the gratuitous horrower for
use. (Is qui utendum accepit exactam diligentiam custodiae rei
pmestare jubetur, Inst. 3, 14, 2. In rebus commodatis talis
diligentia praestanda eet qualem quisque diligentissimus pater-
familias suis rebus adhibet, Dig. 13, 6, 8). 'Phe reason of this
is that the contract of commodatum, being gratuitous, is solely
Α for the advantage of the borrower. (commodatum autem ple-
rumque solam utilitatem continet ejus cui commodatur, et ideo
verior est Quinti Mucii sententia, existimantis, et culpam prae-
standam et diligentiam, Dig. 13, 6, 5, 2). The same principle
may be applied to the depositor and principal (Dig. 47, 23 63, 5).
Extraordinary diligenee is also required of the mortgagee‚ (Placuit
sufficere quod ad eam rem custodiendam exactam diligentiam ad-
hiberet, Inst. 3, 14, 4. Ea igitur quae diligens paterfamilias in
suis rebus praestare solet a creditore exiguntur, Dig. 13, 7, 14),
