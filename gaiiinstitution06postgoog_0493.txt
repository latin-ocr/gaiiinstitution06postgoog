111. ξς 210-219.] coNSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. 471

the damages recoverable by this computation of lucrum cessans and
damnum indirectum should not exceed the double of the immediate
valuc‚ 1100 quod interest dupli quantitatem minime excedere, Cod. 7,
47 ; but left 0161166 founded on delict without any similar limitation.
In claims founded on breach of ’ contract we may distinguish two
obligations ε 1116 primary obligation as defined by the promise of the
contractor, and what we have called, p. 35 7, the secondary or
sanctioning obligation produced by the non-fulfilment of 1116
promise. According to the nature of the contract, this non-ful-
filment will be either the non-performance of some service3 or the
non-delivery of some goodS, movable or immovable3 or non-delivery
at 1116 covenanted time or covenanted place3 or negligent custody
and consequent deterioration or destruction of some article deposited
by the plaintiff3 or eviction of the plaintiff from some property
transferred to him by the defendant3 or any other omission or non·
feasance. The secondary obligation of a defendant may 116 divided
into two portionS, one corresponding to the immediate value to the
plaintiff of the fulfilment of the primary obligation, 13116 other
corresponding 130 1116 mediate or indirect losses occasioned by its
non-fulfllment. 'Phe first portion may 116 regarded as principal, the
second as accessory. Similarly the active obligation or claim of the
plaintiff may 116 divided into two 116116, principal and accessory.
By the enactment of J ustinian, in an action founded on 00611601, 1116
accessory claim cau never exceed 1116 11116011161, 01, 16 011161 words,
the 10161 0161111 of the plaintiff 0611 never exceed in amount twice 1116
value of his principal claim. In obligations arising from delict
there is no primary obligation 01 principal claim capable of furnishing
a corresponding unit of measurement. The primary obligation of
the defendant is 11616 6 necessity of abstention which is 1101 called by
the Romans an obligation: and the primary right of the plaintiff
is a real right, a right against all the world to freedom from mo-
lestation3 which real right is not so definite or capable of exact
valuation or appreciation 66 6 1161601161 0161111. Accordingly the
sanctioning 118111 of the plaintiff in 11116 0666 16 left by J ustinian
without limitation or maximum 3 and the judex is directed to 666666
1116 amount of whatever damage the plaintiff has actually incurred.
The enactment of J ustinian was probably suggested by the
stipulatio duplae annexed to 0011116016 of sale, whereby in case of
eviction the purchaser was entitled to recover from 1116 vendor twice

the purchase-money. Vangerow, ξ 571.
