of legacies receives the inheritance reduced by the Falcidian fourth
of the heres, he is himself entitled to reduce proportionally the
legacies and retain a fourth thereos for himself. Dig. 35, 1, 43, 3.
Dig. 35, 2, 32, 4. E. g. a testator, proprietor of 400, makes A 1110
sole successor, requesting him 130 transfer the whole to B after
deduction of legacies, and leaves a legacy of 300 130 C. Τ110 result
is that the heir retains ἧ- (100); 0οᾶ 1110 remaining 300 10 (110-
tributed between the legatee and transferree, the legatee taking
300 reduced by -ἒ- (225), and the transferree taking that ὲ· (75).
Τ110 same effect would have been produced if the testator, instead
of using the clause deductis legatis, had simply charged the lega-
cies 00 1110 cestui que trust. Or the rights of the cestui que trust
may be calculated with the same result by 13110 following method.
The heres retains :¹5 and transfers {- to the cestui que trust, who
under J ustinian's legislation is no longer a partiary legatee as 110
1100 under the Sc. Pegasianum, but a coheres with the heres in the
proportion of {³- to {a The legatee 10 001111οᾶ to 300 from these
coheirs 10 1110 proportion of their shares of the succession. Τ110
heres, however, is protected by the lex Falcidia, and thus ἦ of the
legacy is lost to the legates: he obtains however Ξ (225) from
the transferree, who retains for himself the remaining -ξ (75).

(4) If the heres makes voluntary aditio, but does not retain
the Falcidian fourth to which he is entitled‚ then, if the legacy
was charged on the inheritance, the whole inheritance is divided
between the transferres and legatee in the proportion of 4 to 3:
that 10, 1110 transferree obtains altogether 2284, and the legatee
1712.

(5) If the 10800)Γ was 0110100013Γ charged on the fideicommissarius,
or if there was no express clause defining whether it was charged
on him and on the 110100, then the legatee will in the first instance
benefit by the heres abstaining from his fourth ε 0οᾶ 13110 transferi-ee
will only get what remains after full payment of the legacy. Thus,
in the circumstances we have assumed, the legatee will get 300 0οᾶ
1110 transferree 100.

(6) If the heres abstains from his {- expressly in favour of the
transferres, the latter alone gains the portion of the heres, Dig. 36,
1, 1, 19.

(7) If the heres only makes compulsory aditio, the 10801300 takes
no share of the Falcidian fourth, which all goes to the transferres
who compelled the heres 130 make aditio· Dig. 36, 1, 2.
