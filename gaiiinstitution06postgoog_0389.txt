111. ἐξ 90, 91.] RE CONTRAOTA OBLIGA'I'IO. 367

By the English law bargains made with expectant heirs and
remaindermen, during the lifetime and without the knowledge of
the parent, may be set aeide by a court of equity on the ground of
unfairness or inadequaey. 'I'he object of this rule, however, is
rather to protect a necessitous borrower against his own impro-
vidence than, as in the senatusconsultum Macedonianum, to remove
temptatione to parricide.

Besides the mutuum there are four other Real contracte, Com-
modatum, Depositum, Pignus , Innominate contract3 each of which
requires a brief notice.

commodatum, a loan for use, is the gratuitous lending of an
article to be used by the borrower. It must be gratuitous, for, if
any compensation 13 to be paid, the transaction eeases to be a com-
modatum, and becomes a letting and hiring (locatio conductio). A
loan for use differs from a mutuum, or loan for consumption, in that
it passes no property to the borrower. Accordingly, in a loan for
use the specific thing that was lent is to be returned, whereas in
a loan for consumption it is only to be returned in kind. Again,
in case of destruction by an inevitable accident, as fire, shipwreck,
or invasion, in a mutuum the loss falls on the borrower, in a com-
modatum on the lender. 'Phe commentatore have expressed this by
the formula, res perit domino, ‘ the loss from destruction falls on
the proprietor,’ but the maxim only applies to contracte of mu-
tuum and commodatum ς for in a sale (emptio venditio), as soon as
the obligation is complete, before the property has passed by de-
livery to the buyer, if the thing is destroyed without the fault of
the vendor, the loss falls on the buyer, and he can be compelled to
pay the purchase-money, although the subject of sale has never
been in his possession. We must not identify the borrower's right
to use, which consiste in an obligatiom with the servitude (jus in
re) or fraction of proprietorship called Usus, which is created by
other methods and governed by different rules.

Depositum is the delivery of a thing for custody, to be re-
delivered on demand, without compensation. It is properly gra-
tuitous, for if a compensation is to be given it is a contraet of
hiring and letting, and not a deposit. The property remains in
the depositor ς the depositary has sometimes Possession, but, as a
rule, merely Detention. The identical thing that was deposited
13 to be returned, not an equivalent of the same kind or quality,
as in mutuum. An involuntary depositor, that is, one under stress
