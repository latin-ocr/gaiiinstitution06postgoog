his praenomen, nomen, cognomen, tribe, could ΒΥ payment of his
debt recover his liberty at any time without the consent of the
creditor, and on recovery of his liberty was not libertinus but
ingenuus. As, then, addictio did not reduce a freeman to slavery,
it did not operate a degradation of status (capitis minutio).
Insolvency, however, deeply affected another branch of status,
namely, civitae, although even here, as it only partially destroyed
the privileges of civitas, it was not considered to operate a eapitis
minutio. Civitas, as we have seen, consisted of two portione,
certain political or public rights, jus suffragii and jus honorum, and
certain civil or private rights, collectively denominated commercium
and connubium. The political half of civitas was destroyed by
insolvency, which deprived a man of his electoral powers and his
capacity for office, and reduced him to the condition of aerarius 3
and even the civil half was seriously impaired, and principally in
respect of commercium. Of the aggregate of capacities called
commercium the privilege forfeited ΒΥ insolvency was the capacity
of appointing or being appointed procurator, Inst. 4, 43, 11. ΒΥ
being disabled from appointing a procurator a man might be ἡ
seriously hampered in his commercial proceedingS, as he would
be unable to cede a right of action 3 by being disqualifled for acting
as procurator he would be unable to acquire by cession a right of
action, and would be unable to sue for a penalty as an informer in
a popularis actio, 4- ξ 82, for the prosecutor in such an action was
considered to be the procurator of the people. The various privileges
enjoyed ΒΥ a citizen of untarnished credit, and liable to be forfeited
ΒΥ insolvency, were called his existimatiO, and the disabilities of
insolvency were summed up in the word ‘ infamia' or ‘ ignominia.'
From this loss of existimatio the insolvent was exempted by bono-
rum cessio, Debitores qui bonis cesserint licet ex eA causa bona
eorum venierint, infames non fiunt, cod. 2, 12, 11. ‘ The surrender of
a debtor’s estate, though followed by -a sale, does not involve infamy. '
(c) Proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency‚ particularly in
modern days, may be looked upon in two lights: either as a mode
of execution, that is, as assisting the creditor to recover as much
as may be of his rights-'ul claime, or as a mode of liberation,
that is, as a relies of an unfortunate debtor, releasing him of his
debts without payment, and enabling him to ‘ begin the world
again ’ without the overwhelming pressure of his past obligations.
