640 DE Aomomssus [Π. ξς 138-170.

suggests, if he sued for the penal sum by Secutorinm with satis-
datio, then when he brought Cascellianum he only recovered the
Res without the interim fructus, The satisdatio would thus in-

crease his certainty of obtaining the amount of the penal sum, but
would diminish by the value of the fructus the total amount

recovered.

Corresponding to the penal sum incurred ΒΥ Fructus licitatio, and
secured by (a) Fructuaria stipulatio or Satisdatio of the litigant
who obtains possession pending interdict procedure, was the liability
in twice the value of the fructus incurred by the litigant who
obtained possession ΒΥ Vindiciae dicendae pending statute-process.
Such at least appears to be the import of a partly conjectural frag·
ment of the Twelve Tables: Si vindiciam falsam tulit, stlitis et
vindiciarum praetor arbitros tres dato: eorum arbitrio possessor
fructus duplione damnum decidito. Festus. ‘ When temporary
possession has been wrongfully obtained, the question of property
and the value of the fruits of possession shall be decided ΒΥ three
arbiters, ΒΥ whose arbit-ration the wrongful possessor shall pay as
a penalty twice the value of the fruits of possession to the true
propr-ictor?

ᾧ 170. From this paragraph, which has been restored by Krueger
from the apograph published ΒΥ Studemund, it appears that as in
Real actions the defendant who declined to give satisdatio judi-

catum solvi and thus impeded the unwinding of the process of
vindicatio was deprived of possession ΒΥ the interdicta Quem
fundum, Quam hereditatem, Quem usumfructum, ᾗ 156 com.; so
a suitor whose contumacious refusal to take the regular steps pre-
vented interdict procedure from accomplishing its normal course
was deprived of possession by interdicta Secundaria.

'Phe mention of vls (qui vm non saciet) shows that, subseqnent
to the issue of the interdict and antecedent to further proceedings‚
one act of the forensic drama was a conventional ejectment (vis ex
conventu), · which may be identified with what is called Deductio
quae moribus fit 1n suits by Sponsio, and perhaps with the Mannum
consertio in Sacramentum, ᾗ 91 com.

The inquiry into the nature of Possnsslou has been purposely
postponed hitherto in order not to interrupt the exposition by
Gaius of the details of the possessory interdicts (Utrubi, Uti pos-
sidetis, Unde vi) ; i.e. those interdicte in which the fact of possession
is itself a title to the continuance or restoration of possession.
