ipso ultimo spiritu simul animam atque libertatem amittebant,
· Inst. 3, 7, 4. ‘Though free in their lifetime, the same moment
that deprived them of life reduced them to the condition of
slaves?

Although in the person of libertus himself, Latinitas was almost
a mockery‚ yet it was not so for his posterity3 these disabilities ·
only attached to the original freedman‚ not to his issue. The 5011
of the dediticius 01· latinus J unianus, though reduced to absolute
penury by the confiscation of the parental property to the patron,
began, and continued, the world with the ordinary capacities, re-
spectively, of peregrinus and Latinus colonial-ius, and was under no
legal obligations to the patron of his father.

Long before the time of Gaius, Latinitas or Latium had only a
juristic, not an ethnographic signification. Soon after the social
war all Italy received the civitas Romana. Originally Gallia Cis-
padana (Sonthern Lombardy) had civitas Romana, while Gallia
Transpadana (Northern Lombardy) had only Latinitas, but Gallia
Transpadana afterwards obtained civitae. Latinitas was 8 definite
juristic conception, and Latin ¹status was conferred as a boon on
many provincial towns and districts that had no connection with
Latium or its races. Vitellius is carped at by Tacitus for his lavish
granta of Latinity (Latium vulgo dilargiri, Hist. 3, 55). Hadrian
made many similar granta (Latium multis civitatibus dedit, Spar-
tian‚ Had. 21), and Vespasian conferred Latin rights on the whole
of Spain, Pliny, Hist. Nat. 3, 4.
