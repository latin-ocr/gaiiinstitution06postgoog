§106. This statement of Gaius respecting a will of castrense
peculium, is inadvertently transferred to J ustinian’s Institutes, but
is inconsistent with a dictum of Ulpian’s in the Digest: Per con-
trarium quaeri potest, an pater ejus qui de castrensi peculio potest
testari, adhiberi ab eo ad testamentum testis possit ⁴? Et Marcellus
libro decimo Digestorum scribit posse: et frater ergo poterit,
D. 28, 1, 20, 2. We have here, then, a case of Antinomy (con-
tradictor-y laws) in J ustinian's legislation.

By English law, 1 Vict. c. 26, any devise or legacy to an attest-
ing witness is void, and the evidence of the witness admissible,
and no person is incompetent to attest on account of being ap-
pointed executor.

In another form of will deriving its validity from the authority
of the praetor, the form of mancipation was dropped, and the only
authentication required was the apposition of the seals of seven
attesting witnesses. Under such a will, however, the devisee could
not take the legal estate or hereditate, but only the equitable estate
or bonorum possessio,

Before the time of J ustinian, a form of will had been established
deriving its validity from three orders of legislation (jus triperti-
tum), the civil law, the praetorian edict, and the imperial constitu-
tions, In accordance with the last, the witnesses were required to
sign or subscribe their names3 in accordance with the praetorian
edict they were required to attach their seals (signacula); and in
accordance with the civil law, their number was required to be seven
(a number obtained by adding the libripens and familiae emptor to
the five witnesses of the mancipation), and the whole formality of
attestation and publication was required to be continuouS, that ie, to
proceed from beginning to end without interruption or interposition
of any other business,

Another form of will is mentioned by J ustinian as perfectly valid
at civil laW, the Nuncupative will, consisting solely of an oral
declaration in the presence of seven witnesses, Inst. 2, 10, 14. A
modification of this produced one of the most solemn forms of tosta-
ment. The nuncupation was made before the Praeses provinciae,

or magistrates of the municipal senate (curia); and thereupon a
memorandum or protocol (insinuatio) of the testator’s dispositione

was made at length in the public records (acta or gesta> of the
