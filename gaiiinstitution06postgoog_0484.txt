is handling a thing with fraudulent intention to appropriate the
property, use, or possession.’

It may be observed that J ustinian does not say with Paulus,
rei alienae, because a man may steal his own property, as when a
pawnor steals from a pawnee or a proprietor ftom a usufructuary.
So, ΒΥ English law, to take a man's own goods out of the hands
of a bailee, if the taking have the effect of charging the bailee,
is larceny. The usus of a thing is stolen when the proprietor
steals from the usufructuary, or when a pawnee unlawfully uses
a pawn. Si creditor pignore utatur, furtum committit, Inst.

Possessio is appropriated when a pawn is stolen ΒΥ the pawnor,
or when the depositary uses a deposuit, or the borrower puts the
thing borrowed to an unauthorized use. In Roman law the
depositary and borrower, unlike the pawnee, have not possession
but merely detention (see 4 § 153), and the same unlawful act
(contrectatio) which amounts to theft converte their detention into
possesslon.

In English law larceny is defined to be the unlawful taking and
carrying away of things personal with intent to deprive the right
owner of the same and to make them the property of the taker.
To constitute larceny the original taking of possession must be
unlawful: therefore, if the owner deliver his property to a person
in trust, the subsequent conversion ΒΥ the bailee, though an offence
and a breach of saith, is not, larceny, because the original taking
was lawful. There are, however, two exceptione to this rule which
desei-ve notice. It is‚larceny if the delivery was obtained by fraud,
i. e. with an original design and pre-arranged plan to deprive the
owner of his property and convert it to the use of the taker. 'Phe
possession is then unlawful in its inception. Again, if delivery
does not divest the owner of the legal possession, conversion ΒΥ the
taket islarceny. In this respect a servant (e. g. a shepherd, carter,
porter, butler, clerk,) is to be distinguished from a bailee, for the
servant is regarded as not possessing, but merely the instrument
of the owner's possession.

As far as Roman law is concerned this principle would make the
bailee, as well as the servant, capable of larceny, for in Roman law
the bailee (except in the case of pignus) has not possession, but
merely detention. 'Phe fact, however, that the pawnee, who has
lawful possession, is guilty of theft if he make use of the pawn,
