engendered to be extinguished by private convention between the
party wronged, and the wrongdoer, Dig. 2, 143 7, 14.

ξ 184. Aulus Gellius gives a fragment of Sabinus which com-
bines the first and third definition of furtum manifestum. Mani-
festum autem furtum est, ut ait Masurius, quod deprehenditur dnm
fit. Faciendi finis est, cum perlatum est quo ferri coeperat, 9, 18, 1.
‘ Manifest theft is that which is detected in the act. The act is
finished when the removal of the goods to the place intended is
eompleted.' J ustinian confirms the third definition, Inst. 4, 1, 3.

ξ 189. The reason why furtum manifestum was subjected to a
beavier penalty than furtum nec manifestum was not because the
barbarous legislator supposed that detection in the act was an
aggravation of the offence, but because he wished, by the amplitude
of the legal remedy offered, to induce the aggrieved party not to
take the law into his own hands and inflict summary vengeance on
the offender, particularly as it was lawful to kin a nocturnal thief,
or one who during the day defended himself with a weapon. In
the infancy of society it is an important object to the legislator to
induce an injured person to have recourse to the public tribunale
instead of righting himself, that is to say, constituting himself
both lawgiver and judge.

That such was really the motive of the legislator we have historic
evidence in the declaration of Rothari, ruler of the Langobar-ds,
A. D. 643. He gives the relatives of the slain their election between
the primitive vengeance for blood (feud or vendetta)‚ and a com-
position or pecuniary fine (wergeld or poena) to be recovered by
action before the public tribunale. He says that he fixes a hig-h
fine in order to induce plaintiffs to forego their right of feud3 and
implies that he would gladly have abolished the right of feud or
private war, but felt that it was too deeply rooted in the habits of his
tribe to be extirpated by legislation. Bethmann-Hollweg, ξ 60.

This writer supposes, ξ 96, that the praetorian action Furti mani·-
festi had a Fictitious formula, 4 § 32, and suggests the following:

Dentonem-atio .· Quod Numerius Negidius Aulo Agerio furtum
manifestum fecit paterae aureae,

Fietio .- Si ob eam rem Numerium Negidium ex lege verberari
itemque Aulo Agerio addici oporteret,

Condemnatio .· Quanti ea res fuit, tantae pecuniae, judex, Nume-

rium Negidium Aulo Agerio quadruplum condemnato: Si non
paret, absolvit0.‘
