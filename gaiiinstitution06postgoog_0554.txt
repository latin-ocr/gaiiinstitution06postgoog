a future day. If he took none of these steps he was liable to an
actio in factum, and he might be apprehended and taken by force
(duci ιιι jus, Dig. 2, 8, 5); and any person who made a violent
rescue was liable to be condemned by actio in factum to pay the
amount of the plaintiff’s claim, quanti ea res est ab actore aesti-
mata, Dig. 2, 75. At the first appearance in court, after the plain-
tiff’s indication of the action be meant to bring (editio actionis),
the defendant was required to give security (vadimonium, or cautio
judicio sisti) for his second appearance in court to receive a judex.
At the second appearance, after the nomination (addictio) of the
judex and the joinder in issue or delivery of the formula (litis con-
testatio, judicium ordinatum, judicium acceptum), there was (at all
events in the legis actiones) an adjournment to the next day but
one (comperendinatio), and on this day the trial before the judex
(judicium) proceeded. In the formulary system, then, there were
two appearances in jure, one in obedience to the in jus vocatio, and
a second for the assignment of a judex. In the Libellary system
which prevailed in the time of J ustinian the former of these ap-
pearances was suppressed, and instead thereof the plaintiff by a
libellus conventionis sued out from the court a commonitio or
summons to the defendant to appear before the court. On the
service of this by a public officer the defendant was required to
give cautio judicio sisti, security for his appearance for the arrange-
ment of a judicium, and in default thereos was ari-ested.

ᾧ 47. 'Phe lawyer's manual of practice contained alternative
formulae for the same ground of action. Sed tamen non parcam
operae, et ut vos in vestris formulis, sic ego in epistolis, de eadem re
alio modo, Cicero ad Familiares, 13, 27. ‘ However‚ Ῑ will spare no
trouble, and as you lawyers do in your books of formulae, I'will pre-
sent you in my correspondence with the same matter in another form.'
Quae cum Zeno didicisset a nostris, ut in actionibus praescribi so-
let, de eadem re dixit alio mode, De Finibus», 5, 19. ‘ Zeno learnt this
from the teachers of our school, and then, as the headings of the
formulae say, handled the same subject in a different form.'

One great advantage of the actiones in factum was that they
were available to aliens and filii familiarum. In factum actiones
etiam filii familiarum possunt exercere, Dig. 44, ⁶7, 13.

We shall see hereafter that actio in factum differed from actio in
jus in respect of (1) Plus petitio and in respect of (2) NovatiO.
