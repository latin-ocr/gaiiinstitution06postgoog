nature of the facts by which the intentio was supported. For in·
stance‚ in Dig. 8, 5, 4, 7, where Ulpian is apparent-ly speaking of
actio Negativa of jus Non altius tollendi, he presently adds: hoc
igitur intendO, habere me jus altius tollendi invito eo cum quo ago:
terms which seem more appropriate for expressing an actio Con·
sessoria of a jus altius tollendi 3 and which probably would express
such an action, if the plaintiff intended to aver a reacquisition of his
original freedom.

In both Confessoria and Negatoria the first proof was incum-
bent on the plaintiff. 'Phe plaintiff Negator of jus Non altius
tollendi or Confessor of jus altius tollendi had first to adduce proof
in support of his contention—which in this case would be simply
to prove the fact of his dominion—-before the defendant was called
upon to prove his opposite contention: and the plaintiff Confessor
as dominant owner of a servitude must begin with adducing proof
of its existence before the defendant is called upon to disprove its
existence or to prove its extinction.

The abolition in England of real actions has destroyed most of
the likeness that once existed in the remedies provided by English
law for the protection or impeachment of Incorporeal hereditaments
(more or less identical with the rights which the Romans called
Servitudes) and the remedies by which at Roman law Servitudes
were protected or impeached. Before the abolition of Real actions
each incorporeal hereditament was asserted or contested ΒΥ some
Real action corresponding either to actio Confessoria or to actio
Negatoria. After their abolition the only remedy is 'Prespass or
Trespass on the case (or their modern equivalents), personal actions
which procure not restitution of a real right, bnt satisfaction in
damages for injury sustained by its contravention, and which will ,
lie as often as the wrong is repeated: or the Court of Chancery will
stay the continuance or progress of a wrong by the issue of an,
Injunction.

As the absolute right of Dominion is supplemented by a less
perfect right, the right of Possession‚ protected by possessory inter-
dicts instead of vindicatio, the remedy of Dominion; so the fraction
of Dominion or perfect right which forms a Servitude is sup-
plemented by an imperfect right, a right of Quasi-possession, also
protected by Interdicts, some identical with those which protect
Dominion, some varying with the nature of the Servitude, ᾧ 139.
