in a servitus tigni immissi, if the dominant owner removes the
beam from his neighbour's wall there is on his part non-usus3 if
the servient owner builds up the orifice in which the beam was
inserted, there is on his part usucapio libertatis, D. 8, 2, 6.
Originally ServitudeS, like Dominion, could be acquired by Usu-
capion3 and as the extinction of Urban Servitudes was governed
by the same conditione, it was regarded by the jurists as an
acquisition of an antagonistic servitude. On the extinction of a

Rural servitude, the servient property simply recovered its original ’

dimensions: an Urban servitude was a permanent diminution of
the servient property, and on its extinction the servient property,
instead of dilatin g to its original size, recovered what it had lost
in the shape of the annexation of a contrary servitude. When at
an unknown date the Usucapion of servitudes was abolished by
a lex Scribonia, an exception was made in favour of these Contrary
servitudes, which in fact were not genuine servitudes, but merely
the expression of the greater difficulty of extinguishing an Urban
servitude. Libertatem servitutum usucapi posse verius est, quia
eam usucapionem sustulit lex Scribonia quae servitutem consti-
tuebat, non etiam earn qnae libertatem praestat sublata servitute,
D. 41, 3, 4, 28. ‘ Extinction of servitude by usucapion is admis-
sible, for the usucapion abolished by lex Scribonia was usucapion
whereby a servitude is constituted, not that which liberates by
extinction of servitude.' Thus he who laboured under a disability
of building (jus altius non tollendi) was regarded on its extinction
as having acquired the opposite easement, jus altius tollendi3 he
who was relieved of the servitus ne luminibus officiatur was re-
garded as acquiring a jus officiendi luminibus vicini ; he who was
relieved from the servitus stillicidii avertendi in tectum vel aream
vicini was deemed to acquire a jus stillicidii non avertendi, D. 8, 2, 2.
It does not appear that the ordinary requisites of Usucapi0, titulus
and bona fides, p. 192, were required in this usucapio libertatis.

In usucapio libertatis, a right being acquired, the ten years are
complete on the commencement of the last day: in non usuS, a
right being lost, the ten years are not complete till the last
day is terminated, 1 §HL Vangerow, ξ 353.

The three servitudes, ne prospectui officiatur, ne luminibus offi-
ciatur, ne altius tollatur, are similar in effect, but differ in their
degree of extension. 'Phe servitus ne luminibus officiatur is not
so extensive as the servitus ne prospectui officiatur, for that may
