by permission of his proprietor. In respect of debts which he in·
curred, the son did not act as conduit-pipe, but (except for a loan of
money, which the Sc. Macedonianum made irrecoverable,) was liable
in his own person. Filiusfamilias ex omnibus causis tanquam pater-
familias obligatur, et ob id agi cum eo tanquam cum patrefamilias
potest, Dig. 44, 7, 39. ‘ A son under power inem-s obligation by
the same titles, and may be sued on the same grounds of action as an
independent person.' The same rule applied to the son as to the
slave: Melior conditio nostra per servos fieri potest, deterior fieri
non potest, Dig. 50, 17, 133. ‘The melioration of his proprietor's
condition is in the power of a slave, but not the deterioration.’

In his political funcffions (munus publicum), filiusfamilias was
entirely beyond the sphere of patria potestas. Quod ad jus publicum
attinet non sequitur jus potestatis, Dig. 36, 1, 14, 1. ‘ The magis-
terial power of a filiusfamilias is unaffected by patria potestas?
Thus, a son could act as praetor, ibid, or as judex, Dig. 5, 1, 17, in
a suit to which his father was a party. He could even preside as
magistrate over his own adoption or emancipation: Si consul vel
praeses filiusfamilias sit, posse eum apud semetipsum vel emanci-
pari vel in adoptionem dari constat, Dig. 1, ’7, 3, (which makes it
doubtful how far political functione were suspended even by the
state of mancipium or bondage). He could also be appointed
guardian (tutor), for guardianship (tutela) was regarded as a public
office. Filiusfamilias in publicis causis loco patrisfamilias habetur,
veluti si vel magistratum gerat vel tutor detur, Dig. 1, 6, 9. ‘ A
filiusfamilias in his public relations is deemed independent, for
instance, as magistrate or as guardian.'

The above-stated incapacities of filiusfamilias were subject, how-
ever, to certain exceptione and modificatione, which may now be
briefly considered.

a. In certain cases filiusfamilias had an anomalous right of suing
in hia own name (suo nomine), i. e. not merely as procurator or
attorney of his father, and even in opposition to his father’s wishes.
Filiusfamilias suo nomine nullam actionem habet nisi injuriarum,
et quod vi aut clam, et depositi, et commodati, ut Julianus putat,
Dig. 44, ¹7, 9. ‘ A filiusfamilias can only sue in his own name for
outrage, by interdict for violent or clandestine disturbance, for
depodt, for loan, according to Juliam’ These suits, which, in spite
of the statement in the text, were not the only, though perhaps the
oldest, actions maintainable by a person under power, desei-ve a
