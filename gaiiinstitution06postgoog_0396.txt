374‘ DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [111. ξς 90, 91.

only Detention. Itaque cum quid precario rogatum est, non solum
hoc interdicto uti possumus, sed etiam praescriptis verbis actione
quae ex bona fide oritur, Dig. 43, 16. ‘The grantor can recover
possession either by the interdict de precario 01 by the equitable
action praescriptis verbis.'

This was an equitable action (ex fide bona) to recover not
merely the value conveyed‚ but also damages for the loss sus-
tained by the plaintiff from default of specific performance. When
the executed part of the convention was a conveyance, if resti-
tution was a sufficient compensation‚ the thing· conveyed might
be recovered back by condictio causa dat-2⁶2, causa non secuta, i. e. a
suit ‘to recover property conveyed for a consideration which has
failed. In qua actione (i. e. si rem do ut rem accipiam) id venit,
11011 ut reddas quod acceperis, sed ut damneris mihi quanti interest
mea illud de quo convenit accipere3 vel si meum recipere velim,
repetam quod datum est, quasi ob rem datum, re non secuta, Dig.

tution, but damages equal to the plaintiff’s interest 111 a specific
performance. Restitution may be enforced by a suit for reconvey-
ance upon failure of consideration.'

It may illustrate the Roman conception of Innominate 01· Real
contract if we indicate the change that has supervened in this
matter from the greater force that is conceded to mere convention
(nuda voluntas) in modern jurisprudence.

With the Romans the execution by one of the parties of his part
osan Innominate bilateral convention was essential to its efficacy.
This execution differentiated the convention from a nudum pactum
and gave it validity‚ but, naturally, only against the party who had
not executed. The party who had executed was not similarly bound:
he had a right of abandoning the contract and recovering back
what he had delivered, not merely when the counter-execution was
not made at the time appointed, or had become impossible by the
culpa of the other party, or had been always impossible (condictio
ob causam non secutam); but when the party who had delivered
simply changed his inclination (condictio ex mera poenitentia).

In German jurisprudence, on the contrary, where every pactum
is treated as if it had been accompanied by Stipulation, that is,
had the validity given by Form—where, in other words, no pacta are
nuda, all are vestita——a convention is enforcible irrespectively of its
part-execution: it is enforcible irrespectively of execution against
