(a) After the abolition of the legis actiones, and the introduction
of execution against the estate, execution against the body of the
debtor still remained as one of the remedies of the civil code. The
insolvent debtor was incarcerated and compelled to labour for the
benefit of the creditor, although he could no longer be sold as a
slave. Of this there are many proofs. Praetor eos duci, bona
eorum possideri, proscribique venireque jubeto, Lex Galliae Cis·
alpinae. ‘The praetor shall order the body of the insolvent to be
delivered to the creditor and imprisoned, and his estate to be
possessed, proscribed, and sold! Quum judicatum non faceret,
addictus Hermippo et ab hoc ductus est, Cicero, Pro FlaccO, 20.
‘ On failing to pay the judgment debt, his body was delivered to
the creditor, and removed to prison.’ [Another perusal of Savigny’s
essay on this subject, Vermischte Schriften, 19, compels me to
accept his conclusion that Personal execution—incarceration, manus
injectio—was always confined to a judgment on a money loan—
mutuum, numerata pecunia: or on Nexum—a fictitious money
loan, a contract transformed or novated by a fiction of a money
loan, particularly a contract for payment of interest, which in itself
was not a contract of mutuum but of stipulatio: or on certain other
obligations assimilated by statute to mutuum, e. g. actio depensi‚
4 §22 Execution against the estate was not, then, a modern
invention but coeval with execution against the body; and was
employed against all judgment debtors except those condemned for
a money loan, real or fictitious, or for depensum or certain other
grounds defined by statute. The lex Poetelia left untouched Per·
sonal execution for genuine money loans 3 and this execution was
still practised 10 the time of J ustinian, though rendered uncommon
by the frequency of Cessio bonorum. The lex Poetelia only abolished
Personal execution for Nexum (a fictitious money loan) though it
also mitigated the treatment of the debtor condemned (judicatus,
addictus) for a genuine loan]. From this personal execution a debtor
was exempted by cessio bonorum. In eo tantummodo hoc beneficium
eis prodest ne judicati detrahantur in carcerem, Cod. 7, 71, 1. ‘ The

principal benefit of bonorum cessio is, that it exempts the insolvent
from incarceration.'

(b) The assignment (addictio) of the insolvent borrower reduced
him to a state of partial servitude. But the Roman lawyers distin-
guished between partial slavery (servire) and complete 'slavery
(servum esse), Quintilian, 7, 3. For instance, the addictus retained
