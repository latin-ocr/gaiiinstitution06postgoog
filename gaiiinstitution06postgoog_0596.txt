expired unless Litis contestatio took place within thirty years from
the nativity of an action; so, after Litis contestatiO, an interval of
thirty years after any act of the judge or one of the parties should
be a bar to any further prosecution of the action. J ustinian ex-
tended this period to forty years, Cod. 7, 39, 9.

The expiration of the commission of the judex by the expiration
of the functione of the praetor who appointed him suggests a
reference to 1 Geo. 3, c. 233 by which act judges are continued in
their offices notwithstanding any demise of the crown, which was
formerly held to vacate their seats.

The divisio'n of actions into those with a pendency of eighteen
months (judicia legitima) and those which expire with the praetorship
(judicia imperio continentia) is not coincident with the division into
those which are ipso jure extinctive of future litigation and those
which are merely counteractive ope exceptionis, ᾗ 106. For although
all judicia imperio continentia, whether in jus or in factum, are
merely counteractive3 some judicia legitima, i. e. real actions and
actiones honorariae‚ are not ipso jure extinctive, ᾗ 107. Gaius,
therefore, was guilty of an inaccuracy when, 3 ᾧῷ 180, 181, he
identified the two divisions.

The reason why real actions and actions in factum had not the
same power of Novation as personal actions in jus was probably, as
Heffter has suggested, as follows: Under the legis actiones, ᾗ 108,
the same question could not be the subject of a second trial. The

ἐξ ,lex Aebutia, which abolished the two legis actioneS, denominated
i judicia and arbitria of the formulary system, probably enacted that

condictio and judicis postulatio, and established in their stead the

these should have the same power of novation, 3 ᾗ 180, as the
actions which they superseded, provided they were instituted be-
tween Roman citizens before a single judex, and within the first
milestone. Proceedings, therefore, thus defined, when once insti-
tuted, extinguished the plaintiff’s right of action. The provision

¹ of the lex Aebutia, however, was not interpreted as applicable to
actions in factum3 for actions in factum were used precisely in

those cases where no right was recognized by the civil law, that is,
where no right was enforceable by statute-process. Nor was it

ffapplied to Real actions, for these were left by the lex Aebutia to be
ἓ decided by the sacramentum, and though they were finally ab·

sorbed by the formulary system, no law, apparently, ever enacted
that in these cases the formulary procedure should have the same
