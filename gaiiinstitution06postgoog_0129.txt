In what respects did domestic bondage (mancipium or mancipii
causa) differ from slavery (servitus)? Bondage was an institute of
Civil law, slavery an institute of the law of nations, ᾧ 52. Bondage
was the result of mancipation by a parent or coemptionator, and
only a Roman citizen was capable of becoming a bondsman.
The proprietor has possession of the slave, the lord has no pos-
session of the bondsman, 2, ᾧ 90. The bondsman was civis Ro-
manus, though what became of his political capacities during his
bondage is uncertain3 and he was liber, though alieni juris: he was
free in respect of the rest of the world, he was only a bondsman in
respect of his domestic superior (paterfamilias). Hence the status
of mancipium was relative3 a man could only be mancipium in
relation to a given domestic lord: whereas the status of slavery was
absolute 3 a man might be a slave without a proprietor (servus sine
domino) : for instance, a person condemned for a capital crime, who
was called the slave of punishment (servus poenae, Inst. 1, 12, 3),
or a slave abandoned (derelictus) by his proprietor. Accordingly,
falling into servitus was maxima capitis diminntin, while falling
into mancipii cansa was minima capitis diminutio, ᾧ 162. The
bondsman had no proprietary rights against his superior, 2, ξ 86,
bnt he had some of the Primordial rights ς for instance, he could
sue his superior for outrage, ξ 1413 and he was capable of civil
wedlock and could beget Roman citizens, though during his bond-
age his patria potestas was in abeyzmce, ᾗ 135 a. Release from
bondage, as from slavery, was by manumission, and the manumittet
became the patron of the released person, ξ 195, but the manumitted
