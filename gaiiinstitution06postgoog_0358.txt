(4) Allectio‚ election ΒΥ the governing body of a community,
admitted strangers to civitas.

It follows that a man might be a citizen of several states3 of one

-ι ΒΥ og-igo, another ΒΥ adpptio, another ΒΥ allectio. This may seem
to be contradicted by Cicero: Duarum civitatum civis esse nostro
jure civili nemo potest, Pro Balbo, 2: but Cicero is here speaking

ἱ of independent sovereign states3 not of the dependent states com-
posing the organism of the Roman empire.

When the lex J ulia municipalis had given Roman citizenship to
all Italy, and an ordinance of Caracalla, subsequent to the time of
Gaius, had extended it to all the Provinces, every member of any
municipality had at least a double citizenship: he was citizen of
Rome as well as of the smaller municipality: Omnibus municipibus
duas esse censeo patriae, unam naturae, alteram civitatis . .
habuit alteram loci patriam, alteram Juris, Cicero, De legibus, 2, 2.
Roma communis nostra patria est, Modestinus, D. 50, 1, 33.

The principal effecte of citizenship m a municipality were three-
sold:

(1) Obligation to bear certain burdensome municipal offiees·
(munera);

(2) Subjection or obligation of submission to the municipal magis-
trates and tribunale, including liability as defendant to be sued
before its courts (forum originis) 3

(3) Subjection to municipal laws, including the determination of
a man’s personal capacity—infancy‚ minority, majority, capacity of
disposition, δια-ΒΥ the laws of the community in which he had
civitas (lex originis).

In all these effecte a man’s Roman citizenship was of slight im·
portanee compared with his municipal citizenship. The bus-dens
(munera) of the metropolitan city were provided for by arrange-
ments peculiar to Rome. 'Phe liability of a defendant to be sued
before a Roman forum was limited to the time when he happened
to be resident in Rome, and then was subject to 'many exceptione,
included under the general name of jus revocandi domum: and in
any case of collision between the laws relating to personal capacity,
the laws of Rome always yielded to those of the local patria or
father town (lex originis).

In all the above consequences Domicil (domicilium, incolatus,
domus) had an operation similar to civitas. Domicil is the place
which a man has voluntarily chosen for his permanent residence, as
