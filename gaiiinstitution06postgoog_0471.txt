legates of the thing which 116 has stolen from the heir who sues
him for theft, and the condition is fulfilled after Litis contestatio,
the defendant is acquitted, Dig. 13, 1, 14, pr.

(b) Litis contestatio made an exception to the latter rule in
respect of the ancient institution of Usucapi03 which though not
interrupted by litis contestatio, did not entitle the defendant to
absolution, as litis contestatio made it revocable‚ Dig. 6, 1, 18.
Longi temporis praescriptio, like other forms of Prescription, was
interrupted by litis contestatio, or, in later times, by Insinuatio:
and from Cod. 7, 33, 10 and cod. ¹7, 40, 2, this seems to have been
the result when J ustinian transformed longi temporis possessio into
Usucapion. Savigny, however, ἕ 261, and Vangerow, § 160, hold
that then the rule of Prescription was in this respect superseded by
the rule of Usucapion: that litis contestatio or insinuatio produced,
that is to say, not interruption but liability to revocation.

(c) Litis contestatio produced another exception to the rule in
the event of the destruction of the subject of litigation by casualty
(casus). In Real actions if the defendant is a Mala fide possessor;
in Personal actions if he is Morose (a debtor chargeable with mora)
destruction of the subject, although ascribable to Casus, and not-
withstanding the maxim: Impossibilium non est obligatio, does not
save the defendant from condemnation. In the absence of Mala
fides and Mora, casual destruction of the subject entitles the
defendant, in virtue of the above maxim, to absolution. See p. 305.

, (d) Litis contestatio makes transmissible a right of action which
before was untransmissible. Vindictive actions (actiones vindictam
spirantes), so long as there has been no litis contestatio, are incapable
of active transmission3 i.e. transmission to the heir of the plaintiff ε
and penal actions are incapable of passive transmission; i.e. trans·
mission to the heir of the defendant. But when once litis
contestatio has taken place, these actions, in the event of the
subsequent death of the plaintiff or defendant, become capable
respectively of active and passive transmission, 4 ἕ 112.

(e) In an action 011 Tort when a man is only suable to the extent
of his enrichment thereby, the questlon whether heis enriched or
not 16 decided entirely by 1116 circumstances at the moment of litis
contestatio. ·

It was stated that as a general rule the plaintiff’s title to judgment
was required to be in existence before litis contestatio, This is
subject to exception in respect of some of the subordinate elements
