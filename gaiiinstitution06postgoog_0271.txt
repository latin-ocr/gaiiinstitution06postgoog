heredes sunt velut filius filiave,

tisve snus heres sit, non suffieit eum

fuisse, md opus est, ut pater quoque
eius vivo patre suo desierit suus
heres esse, aut morte interceptus

in locum sui patris succedunt.

ξ 157. Sed sui quidem heredes
ideo appellantur, quia domestici
heredes sunt, et vivo quoque pa-

mantur- unde etiam si quis intes-
tatus mortuus sit, prima causa est
in successione liberorum. necessarii
vero ideo dicuntur, quia omnimodo,

a grandson or granddaughter by the
son, and further similar lineal de-

is, however, not sufficient that they
were in the power of the grand-
father at the time of his death, but it
is further requisito that their father
in the life of the grandfather shall
have ceased to be sels-successor,
whether by death or by any other
mode of liberation from parental
power, as the grandson and grand-
daughter then succeed to the place
of the father.

ξ 157. They are called sslf-suc-
