ξ 63. Tamen iudici . . . compen-
sationis rationem habere mn ipsius
formulae verbis praecipitur 3 sed
quia id bonae fidei iudicio conve-
niens videtur, ideo officio eius con-
tineri creditur.

ξ 64. Alia causa est illius actionis
qua argentarius experitur: nam is
cogitur cum compensatione agere,
id est ut compensatio verbis formu-
lae comprehendatur. itaque argen-
tan‘us ab initio compensatione facta
minus intendit sibi dare oportere.
ecce enim si sestertium x milia de·
beat Titio, atque ei xx debeat Titius,
ita intendit: si paret Titium sibi x
” milia dare oportere amplius quam
ipse Titio debet.

ξ 65. Item . . . bonorum emptor

· cum deductione agere debet, id est

ut in hoc solum adversarius con-
demnetur quod superest, deducto eo
quod invicem sibi defraudatoris no·

ξ 66. Inter conpensationem au-
tem quae argentario interponitur, et
deductionem quae obicitur bonor-um
emptori, illa dafferentia est, quod in
compensationem hoc solum vocatur
quod eiusdem generis et naturae
est. veluti pecunia cum pecunia
compensatur, triticum cum tritico,
vinum cum vino: adeo ut quibus-
dam placeat non omni modo vinum
cum vino, aut triticum cum tritico

§ 63. The judex is not expressly
instructed by the terms of the
formula to make compensation, but
as it seems fit and proper in an
equitable action, the power is as-
sumed to be contained in his com-
mission.

ξ 64. It is otherwise in the action
instituted by a banker for the bal-
ance of an account, for the banker
is compelled to make express recog-
nition of compensation in his formu-
la, and accordingly allows for any
credit-items from the first, and in
his Intentio only claims the balance.
If he owes ten thousand sesterces to
Titius and Titius owes him twenty
thousand, his Intentio runs as fol-

llows: ‘ If it be proved that Titius

owcs him ten thousand sesterces
more than he owes Titius!

§65. Likewise the purchaser of
a bankrupt's estate must notice any
cross demand in his formula, and in
the condemnatio only require the
defendant to pay what he owes aster
deduction of what was due to him
from th'e insolvent.

ξ 66. Between the compensation
which is made against the claim of
the banker and the deduction from
the claim of the execution purchaser
there is this differ-enee, that com-
pensation is confined to claims of
the same genus and nature 3 money,
for instance, is set off against money,
wheat against wheat, or wine against
wine 3 and some even hold that not
every kind of wine or every kind of
wheat may be set off against wine
and vileat, but only wine and wheat
of the same nature and quality.
Deduction, on the contrary, is made
