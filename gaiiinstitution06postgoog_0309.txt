11.§§ 245-259.] DE FIDEIOOMM. HEREDITATIBUS. 28⁷

§246 The dispositione of a testator which have been hitherto
considered were directions addressed to his successor, resembling
the orders of a father to his son or of a master to his slave, or the
commands of a magistrate to his subordinate or of the state to its
members. Hence the importance of the regular institution of a
successor, of finding a person who, being a mere creature of the
taetatoffs, shall be compelled to execute his commandS.

Fideicommissa, to which we now proceed, are not commands, but
requests. Legatum est quod legis modo, id est, imperative, testa-
mento relinquitur, nam ea quae precativo modo relinquuntur fidei-
commissa vocantur‚ Ulpian, 24, 1. ‘ A legacy is a legislative or
imperative testamentary disposition: a precative disposition (a
disposition in the form of entreaty) is a trust.'

The original object of trusts was to extend the testator's bounty
to those who were legally incapacitated to be legatees 3 for instance,
aliens and Latini J uniani 3 for though Hadrian subsequently inca-
pacitated aliens for taking the benefit of a trust, yet, as declaratione
of trust were exempt from many other restrictions which hampered
direct devises, they survived the circumstance which was the
principal motive of their introduction. For instance, another ob-
ject of the declaration of trusts was to avoid the restrictions im-
posed by the lex Falcidia on the amount of legacies bequeathable
to legatees who were capable of taking (had capacitas as well as
testamentifactio passiva), and this object would continue to operate
as a motive for the employment of trusts even after the invalidation
of trusts in favour of Latini J uniani.

That trusts had originally no legal validity, we see from Cicer0,
Verres, 2, 1, 47, where we learn that it was usual for the testator
to make the successor take an cath to perform the testator’s
wishes, thus supplying by religious motives the want of a poli-
tical sanction. But Augustus, as we are informed by Justinian,
in some individual cases of breach of trust directed the consuls
to inter-pose their authority and compel trustees to execute their
charge3 and trusts soon became an ordinary mode of testamen·
tary disposition, and, in process of time, a permanent fiduciary juris-
diction was established, the court of the praetor fideicommissarius.

Originally if a testator wished to leave to a certain person the
net amount of his fortunes, unsaddled with the burden of admin-
istration, he instituted another as heres, whose sole function was
the ntisfaction of creditors and the discharge of the other duties· of
