DE OBLIGATIONIBUS.

§88. Nunc traamammadobliga- ξ 88. We proceed to treat of
tiones. quarum summa divisio in obligatione, which fall into two
duas species deducitur: omnis enim principal classes, obligations created
obligatio vel ex contractu nascitur by contract and obligations created
vel ex delicto. by delict.

ξ 89. Et prius videamus de his ξ 89. We first treet of those which
quae ex contractu nascuntur. harum are founded on contract, which are
