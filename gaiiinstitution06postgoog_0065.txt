the eovereign ‘ sways uncontrolled 3’ or in the words of another
poet, ἦ πόλις ἐβούλεθ’, ᾗ νόμων οὐδὲν μέλει, ‘ such the state'e plea-
sure, whom no law restrains.’ Nor has the eovereign any rights
like those of a subject by positive law3 and this absence of pro-
tection by positive sanctione may be expressed by the aphorism—
the eovereign’s might is his right. 'Phe eovereign body, of course,
cannot emancipate itself from the law of prudence‚ nor from the
ethical law, nor from the divine law, but these are the only lawe
from which it is not emancipated. Constitutional law cannot be
enforced against the eovereign body by any but moral sanctiens.
Whereas, then, the law of Pereons that belongs to private law is
just as much positive law as the law of Things, and political
functionariee who exercise a delegated power fall under a positive
law of PersonS, the absolute eovereign is not invested with legal -‘.

stitutional law changes its character, it ceasee to be positive law,
and becomes a law of opinion3 or, in other words, public law, so
far as it relates to the eovereign, is not properly laW, but only a
collection of ethical maxims.

In speaking of Constitutional law as a law of status, we must be
understood as using the language of theoretical jurisprudence, not
of Roman law: the classical jurists use the term status to denote —-
exclusively relations of private persons, denoting by the status of
civitas the rights, political or civil, of the private citizen, not the
political attributes of the magistrate.

Before we terminate our general remarks on the nature of status,
it is necessary to distinguish from the law of Persons a department
of law with which, in consequence of a verbal ambiguity, it is

sometimes confounded. Blae-{stone deserves credit for having re· ff: ¹⁴ · ' '¹

cognized Public law as a part of the law of Pereons3 but he also
included under the law of Persons that department of primary
rights to which belong the right of free locomotion, the right of
using the bodily organs, the right to health, the right to reputation,
and other rights which perhaps more commonly emerge in the
redress meted out for their violation, that is, in the corresponding
sanctioning rights, the right of redress for bodily violence, for
false imprisonment, sor bodily injury, for defamation, and the like.
