1.

Titulus usucapionis, Dig. 41, 9, 1, was any disposition capable of
conferring ownership which failed in some instance to confer owner-
ship in consequence of the absence of some particular condition.
It does not appear that the term Titulus was ever applied to the
justa causa Traditionis (solutio, contractio, donatio) by the classical
jurists as stated, pp. 173, 202: although we find a Titulus usum-

pionis called Causa possidendi, Dig. 41, 3, 29.

2.

It is stated, p. 399, that Expromissio is only another aspect of
Delegati03 and, p. 430, that Delegatio always involves two Nova-
tions, a novation of the debt of Delegans to the Delegatee, and a
novation of the debt of Delegatus to Delegans. These statements
are based on too narrow a view of the relations that may subsint
between the three parties to a Delegatio (Delegans or the Delegator,
Delegatu8‚ and Creditor or the Delegatee).

(1) The Delegans may have towards the Delegatee solvendi
animus, credendi animus, or donandi animus,

(2) Delegatus may have towards Delegans solvendi animae,
credendi animuS, or donandi animus.

(1) a. When the Delegator is indebted to the Delegatee and has
solvendi animus, Delegatus is expromissor of Delegans‚
and the debt of Delegans is novated. Solvit et qui reum
delegat, Dig. 16, 1, 8, 3.

b. But Delegator may have contrahendi animus: and theu
there is no debt of Delegator to be novated, and Delegatus

is not Expromissor. Si me . . . mutuam pecuniam roga- '
veris, et ego meum debitorem tibi promittere jusserim . . .
Dig. 12, 32.

e. Or Delegator may have donandi animus: then again there
is no debt of Delegator to be novated, and Delegatus is
not Expromissor. Si debitorem meum tibi donationis

causa promittere jussi . . . Dig. 29, 5, 21, 1.
