the open change, declared the auctoritas still necessary, but made it
compulsor-y instead of voluntary—gave the ward a power of extort-
ing it from the guardian. So the act whereby a testamentary heir
accepts an inheritance was originally absolutely voluntary: but
when trusts (fidei commissa) were introduced, and the heir as trustee
or fiduciarius by groundlessly refusing to make the necessary
aditio, which in this case was the mereat form, could produce
intestacy, and thus deprive the beneficiary, fideicommissarius‚ or
cestui que trust of the provision destined for him by the bounty
of the testator: instead of declaring the aditio of the heres unneees-
sary to the acquisition of the fortune by the fideicommissarius 3 or
that in such a case the beneficiary should be deemed to be a direct
substitutus of the heres3 or that the vexatious refusal of the heres
should be deemed to be an aditio and restituti03 the legislator
ordained that the heres should be compelled to make aditio in order
to complete the title, 2§ 258. Again, the terms of the security
given by the guardian (rem pupilli salvam fore) against dilapi-
dation of the estate of the ward made the responsibility of the
guardian depend on his actual administration3 so that he was not
responsible if the estate went to ruin in consequence of his total
abstention from the performance of his duties. To protect the ward
against this contingency, instead of altering the formula of the
‘satisdatiO, and making the liability of the guardian depend on his
appointment and not on his acting 3 the legislator compelled him
to proceed to some act of guardianshi p, in order to bring him under
the unchanged terms of his security. In all these and other cases
’ a compulsor-y act was substituted for a voluntary act for the sake of
giving the law an outward appearance of antiquity. At last, at
some period before the epoch of J ustinian, the tutelage of women
above the age of puberty had ceased in form as well as in substance,
and no sanction of a guardian, whether voluntary or compulsory,
was required. Ihering.

It is to be observed‚ that as women were gradually enfranchised
from their disabilities, they also forfeited some of their original
privileges It was a rule of the administration of justice that
while error of fact might be pleaded to defend a person against the
consequences of his own acts or omissions, no one should be allowed
to allege an error of law, Dig. 22, 6, 9. Au exception however was
made in favour of minors‚ of soldiers, of the utterly uneducated
(rustici), and of women. Against their ignorance of rules of law,
