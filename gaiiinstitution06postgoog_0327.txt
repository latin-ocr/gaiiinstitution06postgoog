that was lent, and that the condemnatio should coincide with the
intentio; no interest was recoverable even from Litis contestatio·
As, however, this peculiarity of Certi condictio only arose from the
nature of the formula, it ought not to have been retained by J us-
tinian, in whose era. the formulary system had been long dis-
continued.

The result is this: interest on a debt is to be paid, in all but
stricti juris actionS, from the day fixed for payment3 or, failing such
a day, from the day of demand 3 or, failing both such days, from the
commencement of litigation (Litis contestatio): in stricti juris
actions it is only paid from the commencement of litigation‚ and
not even then in Condictio certi. In the first cases the Title to in-
terest is Mora 3 in the last, Litis contestatio,

Mora and Mala fides and Litis contestatio are not only important
in respect of the defendant’s liability for fructus and usurae, but
also in respect of his liability for the intentional (dolus), negligent
(culpa), or, accidental (casus) destruction or deterioration of the
subject of litigation. ,Ἃ

In personal actionS, after Litis contestatio, a defendant is liable 3
for any deterioration whether by dolus or culpa: and whereas before I'
Litis contestatio he is only liable for deterioratiobn produced by gross ἱ
negligence (culpa lata), after Litis contestatio he is liable for any ἕ
degree of negligence (omnis culpa). -

A defendant is liable for accidental destruction or deterioration
(periculum) from the date of Mor-a even before Litis contestatio.

In Real actions the Bona fide possessor must indemnify the
plaintiff for any deterioration produced either by dolus or by culpa
after Litis contestatio: for after that stage he is under an obliga-
tion to use the utmost care in the custody of the matter in
dispute.

The Bona fide possessor might become Morosus or guilty of Mora
after Litis contestatio, namely by contumacious disobedience to the
order (arbitrium, jussus) of the judex directing him to make restitu-
tion3 and then he became liable for casus, In modern Roman
jurisprudence, the actiones arbitrariae being discontinued , this liability
of Bona fide possessor for casual deterioration after Mora can never
occur.

The Mala fide possessor is liable for culpa as well as for dolus
even before Litis contestati03 but, in the absence of Mora, heis not
liable for casus. After Litis contestatio he is liable for casus3 and
