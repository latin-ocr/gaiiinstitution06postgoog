224 DE RERUM UNWERSITATIBUS. [11. ἕξ 109-114.

D. 28, 3, 12, so that practically the existence of a pretermitted
suus heres at· the time of the testator’s death was alone important.

(B) The Honoratus or the recipient of the testator's bounty,
whether heres or legatarius, required testamentifactio passiva,
which like testamentifactio activa meant Commercium or capacity
of taking part in mancipatio, Accordingly both a filiusfamilias
and a Latinus could be heres or legatee (for the limitation, however,
of the capacity of Latinus J unianus by the lex J unia Norbana
see below). This capacity must exist at three periods (tria tem-
pora): the making of the will, the death of the testator, and the
acquisition of the succession by the heres (aditio). 'I'he interval
between the making of the will and the death of the testator was
immaterial, Inst. 2, 19, 4, D. 28, 5, 59, 4. The interval between
the death of the testator and the aditio of the heres was material,
because on the incapacitation of the first heres institutus the in-
heritance would be instantaneously delated (offered for acceptance)
to the heres substitutus or to the successor ab intestato.

The looking to the capacity of Honoratus at the date of making
the will as well as later, though apparently based on no motives of
testamentary policy, but only due to the mancipatory form of the
primitive will, which was ostensibly a mancipatio inter vivos,
i. e. a disposition taking effect in the lifetime of the mancipator,
was retained in J ustinian’s legislation after wills had lost their
mancipatory form.

In respect of Honoratus it is necessary to distinguish institutio
from acquisitio (aditio); and testamentifactio passiva, competence
for institution, from capacitas or jus capiundi, competence for
acquisition. Testamentifactio passiva was required at the date of
the making of the will ; and in its absence a disposition was deemed

to be unwritten (pro non scripto habetur); and the property dis-
posed of went by Accretio to the other heredes scripti. Capacitas,
in its distinctive sense, was only required at the date of acquisition;
and in its absence the unacquired property became cadamus, and
devolved in part or in whole to certain persons or to the state, as
determined by the laws of caducity.

Incapaces, or persons who from want of capacitas forfeited part
or the whole of the testator's bounty, comprehended:

(1) Latini Juniani, who were made incapable by the lex Junia
Norbana, 1 ᾗ 23, 2 ξ 110, 2 ξ 275. But see Ulpian‚ 17, l.

(2) The unmarried (coelebs), married but childless (orbus),
