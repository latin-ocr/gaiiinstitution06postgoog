ιν. ξς 45452] IUSIURANDUM IN LITEM. 535

last stage of· Roman ssaw, the plaintiff recovered the specific object

of litigation and not its pecuniary value. But it would be strange if 2

Roman jurisprudence had thus retrograded, and its second stag-e had
been less perfect than its first: and the meaning of Gaius doubt-
less is, that, whereas in the Formulary system a single action decided
the claims of the plaintiff and assessed their money value, in the primi-
tive system two actions were necessary ,- a principal action to decide
on the justice of the plaintiff's claim, and a supplementary action (ar-
bitrium liti aestimandae) to transform it into money. Probus appa.-
rently gives the terms in which the plaintiff who had succeeded in his
principal suit demanded an arbiter to assess the damages: Arbitrum
liti aestimandae postulo te, Praetor, uti des. This arbitrium was not
reckoned among the forms of statute-process because it was merely
accessory to the principal action. Bethmann-Hollweg‚ ξ 87.

Two incidents of litis aestimatio in the formulary procedure
deserve notice: (1) J usjurandum in litem, and (2) the determination
of the Momcnt to be considered hy the judex in appraising the
value of the plaintiff's interest.

(1) Jusjurandum in litem was not like jusjurandum necessarium
a substitute for a judgment, but only one of the means of proof
whereon in certain actions a judgment might be founded. These
actions were (a) principally actiones arbitrariae. 'l'o induce the
defendant 130 avoid condemnation by obedience to the judge’s arbi-
, tratus, if the defendant contumaciously refused obedience, or by

dolus ‚or culpa lata had rendered himself unable to yield obedience
to the order of the judex, the value of the plaintiff‘s interest in the
subJ'ect of litigation (litis aestimatio) was not ascertained, asin other
cases, by the judex with or without the aid of experte, but by the
oath of the plaintiff. Although he was required to name the true
value (quanti actoris intersit) not a mere fancy value or so-called
value of affection, yet his conscientious estimate would naturally be
higher than that of an impartial judge or disinterested valuer: and
the largeness of the alternative condemnation would incline the

defendant to make a specific restitution.
(b) Even in actiones stricti juris, if litis aestimatio, owing to the

culpa of the defendant, is otherwise impossible to the jude13 if, for ·

instance, in the actio legis Aquiliae the subject has ceased to exist,
then the judex may employ the oath of the plaintiff as a subsidiary
evidence of the plaintiff’s particular interest in the subject and of

its market value. Vangerow, ξ 171.
