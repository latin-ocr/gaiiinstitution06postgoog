stantive code of certain principles respecting the nullification of
rights which practically answered the purpose of the Exceptions
afterwards introduced into the Adjective code.

An example of such principles is the rule: Impensae necessariae
dotem ipso jure minuunt, Dig. 22, 4, 5, 2. A husband when com-
pelled to restore the dower 150 a divorced wife was fairly entitled
to deduct what he had been obliged to spend for its conservation
during the subsistence of matrimony. To enable the husband to
do this the law nx‘rmsmsnnn the wife’s right to an equivalent
portion of the dower, and thus protected the husband as effectually
as if it had given him an Exceptio asserting an independent right
of retention. So the rule: Legata pro rata portione per legem
ipso jure minuuntur, Dig. 35, 2, ⁷3, 5, gave to an heir the rightof
retaining his Falcidian fourth as effectually as be could have done
by pleading an Exceptio legis Falcidiae. Again the rule: Ipso
jure minutum esse peculium, Dig. 19, 1, 30, pr„ gave to an heir,
when a slave and his peculium had been bequeathed to a legatee,
the right of deducting whatever the slave owed by naturalis
obligatio 150 the testator as effectually as if he had been allowed to
plead the debt of the slave in an Exceptio..

It is remarkable that a husband's right to deduct from the dower
all utiles as opposed to necessariae impensae was protected by an
Exceptio, Dig. 25, 1, 7, 4. As there seems to be no valid reason for
a different treatment of utiles impensae and necessariae impensae,
the explanation why the deduction of necessariae was effectuated
by Extinction and that of utiles by Exception can only be found
in the hypothesis that the former right was recognized by the
lawgiver before, the latter after, Exceptions had been introduced
into the Adjective code. Ihering, ᾧ 52.

These phenomena may incline us to suppose that an enactment
of J ustinian, which commentators have been much embarrassed to
explain, that Compensation should operate by Extinction (ipso jure,
Cod. 4, 31, 14), when Exception (here assuredly the natural mode of
expressing the true facts of the case) would have answered exactly
the same purpose, was a mere anachronism. J ustinian intended to
assimilate Compensation to the deductione from Boe, Legatum,
Peculium: but overlooked the fact that in those cases the method
of Extinction was employed by the lawgiver instead of Exception, ⁵ Μ ⁹²2 J

merely because, when those deductione were first authorized, Excep- yffi ⁶ ““ ²² '

tion was unknown to jurisprudence.
