are several solidary sureties of the same debt, and one is sued, the
remainder are not discharged of liability by 1110 0000113101, but are
discharged by his satisfaction of the debt.'

It was possible to avoid the consumption or extinction of
the right of action against the surety tbat was operated by suing
mthe principa] by so shaping the formula of fidejussio as not to

ι, produce Correality,I)ig.45,1, 116. But at a later period the whole

principle of process· consumption (extinction of right to sue by litis
contestatio) was tacitly abandoned. and J ustmian expressly enacted
that m Correality as well as in Solidarity only actual satisfaction of
a claim should operate a consumption of the right of action.
Generaliter sancimus, quemadmodum in mandatoribus statutum est,
nt contestatione contra unum ex his facta alter non liberetur, ita et
in fidejussoribus observari. Et ideo generali lege sancimus nullo
modo electione unius ex fidejussoribus vel ipsius rei alterum liberari,
vel ipsum reum fidejussoribus vel uno ex his electo liberationem
mereri, sed manere jus integrum donec in solidum ei pecuniae
persolvantur vel alio modo satis ei fiat. Idemque in duobus reis
promittendi constituimuS, Cod. 8, 41, 28. ‘We ordain that as in
guaranty by mandate joinder in issue against one guarantor does not
discharge another, the same rule be observed in guaranty by stipu-
lation . . . and that election to sue one fidejussor or the principal
shall not discharge another fidejussor, nor shall election to sue the
fidejussore or one of thern discharge the principal, unless satisfaction
be made to the creditor, whose rights shall remain intact until he
has received complete payrnent or other satisfaction3 and the same
rule shall be observed wherever there is Correality between pro-
misorsss J ustinian's ordinance is introduced into the Digest by means
of a bold interpolation: Cum utro velit Seius aget, ut, si cum uno
actum sit et solutum, alter liberetur. Pomponius, Dig. 30, 1, 8, 1.
2. A second difference between Correality and Solidarity consiste
in the fact that in Solidarity the guarantor who pays the whole has
regressus against his co-guarantors, that is to say, has a power
of recovering from them contribution of their share of the debt:
whereas the Cori-eal debtor who pays has no regressus or right to
contribution. (Ι have here followed Vangerow: Sav'igny attempta
