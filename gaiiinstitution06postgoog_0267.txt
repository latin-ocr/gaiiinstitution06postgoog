petitio, admissio, bonorum possessionis), within a certain period',
usually 100 dies utiles from the date of the vocatio (delatio). On
the claim being made, the grant (datio) of bonorum possessio
followed as a matter of course without any judicial investigation
(causae cognitio). It was a mere formality‚ a certificate of the
magistrate, the praetor or praeses provinciae, that the agnitio
had been made within the allotted period, before the expiration of
the term allowed for deliberation. If any real controversy arose,

it was decided ΒΥ one of two actions, hereditatis petitio, or the
Interdict Quorum bonorum. If the claimant relied on his title

at civil law, he sued by hereditatis petitio3 if he relied on the
title given him by the praetorian edict, he sued ΒΥ the Interdict
Quorum bonorum. If defeated in either of these proceedings, he Ι
gained nothing by having obtained the formal grant of praetorian
succession-—he had only bonorum possessio sine re. See 4 ξ 144.

§ 150. Originally when a heritage was vacant from the failure
of intestate successore, Ulpian 28, 7, οι· from the neglect of a devisee
to take possession, ξ 52, any stranger might take possession and
acquire ΒΥ usucapio. In the case of testacy this right was abolished
by Sc. J uventianum ε and by lex J ulia caducaria in default of all
other intestato successors a heritage devolved to the state (fiscus).
The state did not become necessary successor (ipso jure) but had the
delatio (ad populum deferri jubentur), i.e. had the right of deliberation
and acceptance or repudiation, Inst. 3, 11, 1. As universal suc·
cessor the state could by the terms of Sc. J uventianum recover
from the unentitled occupant by Hereditatis petitio, D. 5, 3, 20, ⁷,
and could transfer its rights to a purchaser ΒΥ Sc. Trebellianum,
ibid 54, pr.

'I'he Fiscus was bound to pay all codicillary legacies and trusts:
and succeeded to all the obligations* active and passive, in other
words, to all the personal rights and personal duties, of the
heritage-leaver: but like other successors might, by taking ad-
vantage of the Benefice of inventory, confine its liability to the
extent of the assets. In the event of the repudiation of the suc-
cession by the Fiscus, the goods were sold for the benefit of creditors.
