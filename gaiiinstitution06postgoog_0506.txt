§L From substantive law Gaius now μω to the-law of Pro-
‹aedui-e, confining himself for the most part to its ΜΔΕ-ἘΙ as oppooed
to its Formal aspect : dealing with procedure, that is to Sty, not so
fiir as it is merely the method of rffllizing pre-existing rights, but
rather so far as its stages are title-s which, like Dispositions and
Tor-15, themselves orig-{nate new rights and new obligations.

If we inquire which code is the earlier in its development, the
Substantive code or the code of procedure, the answer is that they
are essentially contemporaneous: a Substantive code can have no
actual existence unless there is some method os giving it force, und
again a code of procedure can have no meaning unleoe there ist
substantive law to be administered. But aster recognizing that the
two codes are correlative and necessarilv coexistent‚ we find that
hi sto ricully the code of Procedure is prior in the chronological
order: it attains to a high gmde of development, while the Sub-
stantive code which started into birth at the oeme time remains
in a rudimentary undeveloped condition. The tribunals once
established by the legislator soon evolve strict rules to govern their
prm-ecdings, while the legislator is too much occupied with wars
domestic and foreign to furnish the substantive law which the tri-
bunals ought to administer.

The following contr-ast of ancient and modern jurisprudence here
deserves a notice. No primm-y rights cnn be conceived without
sanctioning rights, or rights which arise when the primary rights
are violated: and again no sanctioning rights cun be conceived
without Actions or modes of evoking the interposition of the
sovereigu power. And, as Rights imply Action3‚ so reciprocnlly
- Actions imply Rights. But though, as corresponding or cor-related
terme, Right and Action have a necessary connexion, and the
existence of one may be inferred from the existence of the other;
two systems of jurisprudence may differ as to which of these terms,
the Right or the Action, they deem the more evident3 which they

regard as the datum and which the matter to be proved3 which the
logical premiss and which the conclusion.
