When the same right is in question it is immaterial that the
subject or secondary object (2 ξ 1, commentary) of the right is
different. Thus, a plaintiff claiming to be heir, who fails when he
brings hereditatis petitio for Blackacre, cannot afterwards bring
hereditatis petitio for Whiteacre as a part of the same inheritance.
Of course, if there is no question of hereditas, the difference of
Subject involves a different right of Ownership: and the Vindicatio
by which a man claims Blackacre is not barred by a previous Vin-
dicatio in which he claimed Whiteaere.

Perhaps the same right may be in question even when the
primary object, the benefit which the right immediately contem-
plates, is different. Thus, a plaintiff who fails in a condictio furtiva
brought to recover stolen property, cannot afterwards maintain an
actio furti to recover a penalty sor theft. We might say that the
plaintiff has a single compound right, to recover his property and
to recover a penalty, but perhaps it is more accurate to say that
he has two separate rights which, however, stand or fall together
by necessary implication, and to bring this case under the following
head.

It is immaterial, namely, whether a proposition was deeided as
the final question, or as an essential element and immediate ground
of the final decision (ratio decidendi). Every judgment is a decision
not only on the ultimate issue, but by implication on all the ante·
cedent pleae, not only the exception, replication, duplication (for
these are exclusive! y counteractive, not extinctive‚ pleas, ᾧ 115), but
also on all facts, e. g. solutio, acceptilatio, novati0, which would be
put in issue in English pleading, as necessary to legitimate the
final decision, even if, as forming extinctive pleaS, they would not
be expressed in a Roman formula. Thus, a plaintiff who fails when
he sues by real aetion sor a particular thing, or by a personal action
for a debt, basing his claim on the presupposition of his succession
to a person deceased, cannot afterwards claim the whole succession
by hereditatis petitio. Hence we osten meet with praescriptio
praejudicialis, e. g. Ea res agatur si in ea re praejudicium hereditati
non fiam 133, or exceptio praejudicialis, e. g. extra quam si in reum
capitis praejudicium fiat, Cic. de Inventione, 2, 203 i. e. dilatory
pleas whereby a party seeks to postpone a less important issue
(causa minor) until a more important issue (causa major) with which
it is indissolubly connected, shall have been decided. This prae-
scriptio implies that if the more important issue were decided on
