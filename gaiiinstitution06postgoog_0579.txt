ἕ 78. Justinian decides in favour of the Sabinians, Inst. 4, 8, 6,
that the action for the delict of a slave is extinguished, without
possibility of future revival‚ when the delinquent slave comes into
the power of the person aggrieved. ·

ᾤ 81. ΤΒ6 death of a delinquent slave extinguished the liability
of the master. Sed et mortuo servo antequam judicium accipiatur
omnino hac actione non tenebitur dominus, Dig. 9, 4, 39, 4. Si
quis pro servo mortuo, ignorans eum decessisse, noxale judicium
acceperit, absolvi debet, quia desiit verum esse, propter eum dare
oportere, Dig. 9, 4, 42, 1. ‘ If the slave die before an action is
commenced, the master is not liable3 and if 611 6611011 16 com-

because his liability is at 66 66(1.’

son or daughter by the parent became repugnant to pubh'c feelingS,
and Justinian speaks of it as a thing of the past. A filiusfamilias
was only liable to execution against his estate. Incarceration for
insolvency was confined to debts arising from 6 money loan. If
a son had contracted such a debt with 1116 fath er’s sanction, the
creditor had his remedy against the father: if the 1066 had not
been sanctioned the debt, was irrecoverable. If the father was
insolvent, both son and father were liable to incarceration.

Si autem damnum ei cui deditus est servus resarcierit ,quaesita
pecunia, auxilio praetoris invito domino manumittetur, Inst. 4, 8, 3.
‘ If a slave surrendered for a delict is able to indemnify the injured
party, he is manumitted without the consent of his master.’

This seems originally 10 have been restricted to the 6666 of a
freeman surrendered for delict. Per hominem liberum noxiae dedi-
tum si tantum adquisitum sit, quantum damnum dedit, manumit-
tere cogendus est a praetore qui noxa deditum accepit, sed fiduciae
judicio non tenetur, Papinian‚ collatio, 2, 3. ‘ On indemnification
by the freeman surrendered for delict, his master is compelled
