testator, 2 ᾧ 154. Universal succession was an institution which
Roman law only admitted in certain cases: as operated by eontract
it was only admitted in case of Manus and Adoptio. If universal
succession was required for the purpose of extinguishing the obliga-
tion to sacred rites attaching to the estate of an heiresS, we might
have supposed that Adrogatio would have been a less offensive
mockery than a fictitious marriage (fiduciary coemption); adrogatio,
however, was inapplicable, because, as we have seen, up to a late
period of Roman law women were incapable of being adrogated.
Moreover, the Pontifices, who had a veto on adrogatione, were not
likely to lcnd themselves readily to the extinctiou of sacred rites.

At other times Coemption was employed to enable a woman to
select a guardian, ᾧ 195. Nam quum permulta praeclare legibus
essent constituta, ea jureconsultorum ingeniis pleraque corrupta ac
depravata sunt. Mulieres omnes propter infirmitatem consilii
majores in tutorum potestate esse voluerunt: hi invenerunt genera
tutorum quae potestate mulierum continerentur, Cic. Pro Murena,
12. ‘ There are many wise legal provisions that juristic ingenuity
has defeated and perverted. All women on account of their weak-
ness ofjudgmeut were placed by our ancestors under a guardian's
control: jurists invented a kind of guardian subject to female dic-
tation.’

The latest employment of Coemption enabled a woman to break
the ties of agnatiou and thus acquire testamentary capacity, ᾧ 115 a.
The coemptionator (party to the coemption) in virtue of the manus
thereby acquired was able, and by a fiducia or trust was bound, to
sell the woman into bondage as if she were filia familias: accord-
ingly he remancipated her to a third person, who by manumitting
her in accordance with another fiducia became her patron, and as
patron, in accordance with the Twelve Tables, ᾧ 165, her statutory
guardian, and, as having acted under a fiducia, her fiduciary
guardian, ξ 115. It may occur to us that as coemptio required
the sanction of a father or guardian, this process could not be of
much use in getting rid of a guardian or defeating the claime of
agnatio guardians to a woman's intestate succession3 but it must be
remembered that the nearest agnate, who alone was heir and
guardian, was a variable person, and that a given nearest agnate
might be not indisposed to allow a woman to acquire the free dis-
position of her property and to defeat the claims of those who, after
his death, would be nearest agnates and presumptive heire. At all
