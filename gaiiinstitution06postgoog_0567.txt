claims will be governed ΒΥ the law (law of the stipulated place of
performance, Sco.) which according to general rules is applicable to
the obligations they respectively seek to enforce.

Exceptions to most of the preceding rules are produced by the
existence of Imperious and Anomalous laws: laws based on reli-
gious, moral, political, financial‚ administrative‚ instead of purely
civil, motives: such as laws relating to heresy, usury, gambling,
revenue‚ mortmain3 or laws implying institutions (e. g. slavery,
civil death) unrecognized ΒΥ other states. Each forum enforces its
own Imperious or Anomalous laws, and disregards those of its
neighbour. For instance a monogamist forum will not enforce
polygamistic laws, nor will any forum enforce the penal laws which
a neighbour levels against its coreligionists. ¹

Obligation founded on Delict is always the subject of such Im-
perious laws: accordingly civil obligation ex delicto, unlike obliga-
tion ex contractu , is governed by the lawe of the forum ΒΥ which it
is remedied.

The rules of which the above are a specimen constitute what is
called the Comity of natione or Private international law. The ideal
aim of the Comity of natione is: that the judgment passed on any
controversy should be identical whatever may be the tribunal that
happens to exercise jurisdiction. Savigny, System, vol. 8.

The penalty of pluris petitio in respect of time was reduced
ΒΥ Zeno, who merely doubled the term that was still to run before
payment, and required the creditor to pay the costs of the former
action before he brought a second, Cod. 3, 10. The effect of
this was to change the meaning of the term ‘ dilatoria,’ which,
as applied to an exceptio and opposed to peremptoria, denoted an
exceptio alleging pluris petitio in Time.

When Gaius wrote, such an exception, if successfully alleged,
was just as fatal to the creditor as an exceptio peremptoria. It was
temporary, not⁴ in respect of its effecte, but of the limited period
during which it was at the command of the debtor. But after Zeno
such an exceptio was temporary in its effecta, and did not prevent
a renewal of the action after a certain lapse of time, that is, after
the expiration of the term originally fixed for the payment, and an
additional term measuring the temporal excess of the plaintiff's
claim. J ustinian retained Zeno’s law in respect of Time, and

“ disarmed the other modes of pluris petitio of their terrore, by

merely making the creditor liable to three times the amount of
