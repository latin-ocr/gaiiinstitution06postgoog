DE OBLIGATIONIBUS.

accept and receive part of the good8, or unless he give something in
part payment or in earnest to bind the bargain.

So far as delivery or payment is essential to the completion of
the contract of sale, it is clear that the contract is not Consensual‚

but Real.

DE LOOATIONE m· CONDUCTIONB.

ξ 142. Locatio autem et con-
ductio similibus regulis constituun-
tur: nisi enim merces certa statuta
sit, non videtur locatio et conductio
contrahi.

ξ 143. Unde si alieno arbitrio
merces permissa sit, velut quanti
Titius aestimaverit, quaeritur an
locatio et conductio contrahatur.
qua de causa si fulloni polienda
curandave, sarcinatori sarcienda ve·
stimenta dederim, nulla statim mer-
cede constituta, postea tantum da·
turus quanti inter nos convenerit,
quaeritur an locatio et conductio
contrahatur.

ξ 144. Vel si rem tibi utendam
dederim et invicem aliam rem uten-
dam acceperim, quaeritur an locatio
et conductio contrahatur.

ξ 145. Adeo autem emptio et
venditio et locatio et conductio
familiaritatem aliquam inter se
habere videntur, ut in quibusdam
causis quaeri soleat utrum emptio
et venditio contrahatur, an locatio
et conductio. veluti si qua res in
perpetuum locata sit, quod evenit in
praediis municipum quae ea lege
locantur, ut quamdiu id vectigal
praestetur, neque ipsi conductori
neque heredi eius praedium aufera-
tur3 sed magis placuit locationem
conductionemque esse.

ξ 146. Item si gladiatores ea
lege tibi tradiderim, ut in singulos
qui integri exierint pro sudore de·
narii xx mihi darentur, in eos vero
singulos qui occisi aut debilitati
fuerint, denarii mille: quaeritur
utrum emptio et venditiO, an locatio
et conductio contrahatur. ct magis

ξ 142. Letting and hiring are
governed by rules like those of
purchase and sale. Unless the sum
to be paid as hire is fixed, the con-
traet is not complete.

ξ 143. Andifthehireistobe
fixed by an arbitrator, for instance,
at the sum which Titius shall con·
sider fair, it is a question whether
there is a conti-act of letting and
hiring. Accordingly, if I give
clothes to a fuller to clean or finish,
or to a tailor to mend, and the re·
muneration is not fixed at the time,
but left to our subsequent agree·
ment, it is a question whether there
is a contract of letting and hiring.

ξ 144. The same question ariscs
if I lend a thing for use and receive
in return the loan for use of another
thing.

ξ 145. Purchase and sale are so
nearly akin to letting and hiring
that in some cases it is a question
under which category a contu-act
falls3 for instance, when land is
leased in perpetuity, as occurs with
the land of mumcipalities, which is
leased on the condition that, so
long as the rent is paid, the lessee
and his heirs shall continue jn pos-
session. But here the better opinion
is that the contract is one of letting
and hiring.

ξ 146. If a band of gladiatore
are delivered on the following terma,
that is to say, that for the perform-
ance of every one who leaves the
arena safe and sound there shall be
paid twenty denarii, and for every
one who is killed or disabled there
shall bc paid one thousand denarii,
