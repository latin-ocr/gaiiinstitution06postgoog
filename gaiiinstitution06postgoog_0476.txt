sed et illorum sententia qui existi-
maverunt, donec perferret eo quo
fur destinasset, deprehensum furtum
manifestum esse, improbata est, quod
videbatur aliquam admittere dubi·
tationem, unius diei an etiam plu-
rium dierum spatio id terminandum
sit. quod eo pertinet, quia saepe in
aliis civitatibus surreptas res in
alias civitates vel ιιι alias provincias
destinat fur perferre. ex duabus
itaque superioribus opinionibus al-
terutra adprobatur: magis tamen
plerique posteriorem probant.

§ 185. Nec manifestum furtum
quod sit, ex iis quae diximus in-
tellegitur: nam quod manifestum
non est, id nec manifestum est.

ξ 186. Conceptum furtum dici-
tur, cum aput aliquem testibus
praesentibus furtiva res quaesita et
inventa est: nam in eum propria
actio constituta est, quamvis fur non
sit, quae appellatur concepti.

ξ 187. Oblatum furtum dicitur,
cum res furtiva tibi ab aliquo oblata
sit, eaque aput te concepta sit; uti-
que si ea mente data tibi fuerit, ut
aput te potius quam aput eum qui
dederit conciperetur. nam tibi, aput
quem concepta est, propria adversus
eum qui optulit, quamvis fur non
sit, constituta est actio, quae ap-
pellatur oblati.

ς 188. Est etiam prohibiti furti
adversus eum qui furtum quaerere
volentem prohibuerit.

§ 189. Poena manifesti furti ex
lege ΧΠ tabularum capitalis erat.
nam liber verberatus addicebatur ei
cui furtum fecerat; (utrum autem

has the goods in his hands. The
fourth opinion has not been adopt-
ed, and the third opinion that,
until the th1ef has carried the stolen
goods to their place of destination‚
he may be detected m the commis·
sion, is also impugned on the ground
of the uncertainty whether one day
or several is the limit of the time
within which he must be detected;
for a thief often intends to carry
the goods he has stolen in one city
into another city or province. The
first and second opinions are com-
monly adopted, and more generally
the second.

ξ 185. Simple theft is theft not
detected in the act.

ξ 186. The discovery of stolen
goods, when a person’s premises are
searched in the presence of wit-
nesses, makes him liable, even
though innocent of theft, to 8
special action for receiving stolen

go<{dis-87. To introduce stolen goods

is to pass them off to a man, on
whose premises they are discovered,
with the intent that they should be
discovered on his premises rather
than on those of the introducet.
The man on whose premises they
are found may sue the passer off,
though innocent of theft, in an
action for the introduction of stolen
goods.

ξ 188. An action for prevention
of search may be brought against
the man who prevents the search of
his premises where stolen goods are
suspected to be concealed.

ξ 189. The punishment provided
by the law of the Twelve Tables for
theft detected in the commission
was capital; a freeman was first
scourged and then delivered, by
judgment of the magistrate, to the
