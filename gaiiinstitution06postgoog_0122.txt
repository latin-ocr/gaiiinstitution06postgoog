eventS, however indisposed the guardian might be to such a course,
a period at last arrived when the auctoritas of the agnatio guardian,
though still required as a formality, could be extorted, if not yielded
voluntarily, by appeal to the magistrate, ξ 195.

Agnatic guardianship of female wards was abolished by a lex
Claudia, ᾧ 171, and thus the woman would be free from the control
of an interested guardian in the disposition of her property during
her lifetime. She would still however be a mere usufructuary or
tenant for life, being devoid of the power of testation. For when
wills could be only executed in the comitia, 2 ξ 101, she would be
excluded from testation, as well as from adrogation, p. 90, by ex-
clusion from the comitia: and after the introduction of the manci-
patory will she was still deprived of testamentifactio by her agnates’
indefeasible claims to her reversion. Agnation itself, however,
was defeasible by means of coemptio and remancipatio and the
consequent capitis minutio 3 and when the auctoritas of the agnates
for these proceedings could be extorted, ξ 195, the woman had
practically acquired power of testation‚ although its exercise was
hampered by a tedious formality, which was not abolished by the
emperor Claudius when he abolished agnatic guardianship. It was
not till the senatusconsult of Hadrian that the rupture of the ties
of agnation by means of coemptio ceased to be necessary to the
validity of a woman’s will, § 115 ας though, as already suggested,
it had probably been a mere formality (the woman having power to
extort at pleasure the auctoritas of the agnatio guardian) long before
the time of Claudius.

Ihering, § 29, explains why capitis minutio was deemed to be
a title that conferred upon a woman a right to make a will, a
phenomenon that certainly requires explanation, by supposing that
the rule was at first adopted in the interest of a married woman's
original family and gens. A woman, who after marriage and
subjection to manus and consequent change of family had by the
death of her husband become sui juris, would, by dying intestate,
leave her property to be inherited by the members of her new
family3 that is by her husband's agnates and gentiles. Accordingly
the power of making a will was given, in the first instance, to the
genuine widow in the interest of her original agnates, to enable her
to divert the devolution of her property from the members of her
husband’s family and gens to the members of the family and gens
of her father. Afterwards‚ when this exceptional privilege of
