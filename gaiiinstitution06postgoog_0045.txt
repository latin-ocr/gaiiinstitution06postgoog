PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS. 23

having a transitor-y existence under special limitatione of time and
place and persons, is a Title. (Compare Savigny, System, ᾗ 384.) Iu
either case the term Institutiou connotes coustaucy aud permaximos,
just as when it is used iu another sense to deuote the monarch, or
legislative body, or tribunale, or any other permanent organa destined
to perform certain constantly recurring functione.

If we are asked, what iu J urisprudeuce are the idem correspond-
ing to the categories of substance, Quality, Quantity, Relatiou, or
whatever else Logiciaus make the immutable framework of their
scieuce, we must point to some of the above abstractions—Law,
Sovereign, Sanctiou, Obligatiou, Title. Without these and similar
conceptious no jurisprudeuce can be imagiued. And to this extent
the bases of j urisprudeuce are natural aud unchangeable‚ bnt to this
extent only. J urisprudeuce has nothing corresponding to the
precise and unalterable smcial conceptione that furuish the first
principles of the mathematiciau. All the particular institutione
that fall under the above-named highest categories are positive,
that is, arbitrary and variable. While Dogmatic jurisprudence
fixes its attention on whatever is most coustant or most perfect in
legislative arrangements or what might be found iu au ideal state,
Historic aud Comparative jurisprudence chiefly bring before our
notice what is variable iu civil institutione. Let us now throw
a rapid glauce over Roman law in order to indicate the extent of
these mutatione iu its civil code, though in so doing we shall be
forced to use by anticipatiou certain technical terms whose explana-
tion mnst be left to the course of the following treatise.

It is uuuecessary to dwell ou the mutatione iu the code of Pro-
cedure, that is, iu the forms of Action, or modes prescribed by the
legislator for the enforcemeut of sanctiouiug rights.

'I'he Substantive code may seem more permanent, but this too
changes entirely iu the fundamental conceptione of its titles and
institutione. ·

Forms of Dispositiou, i. e. the voluutary 'ritles by which the
subject may establish certain rights and obligations put within his
reach by the sovereign, disappear aster flourishing for centurieS‚
like types of animal life. New oues are introduced and old ones
are abolished. Wituess the abolition of Testamentum comitiis
calatis, confarreatio, In jure cessio, Nexum, Mancipatio‚ Literal
obligatiou, and the introductiou of the correspondiug forms of later
law.
