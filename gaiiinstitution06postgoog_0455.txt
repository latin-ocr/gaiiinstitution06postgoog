party sued the principal or vice versa, could have only resulted from
cEssm ACTJONUM, i. e. a transfer of obligations between the agent
and principal, or the agent and the contractee.

However‚ in process of time the law recognized the appointment

of a cognitor or representative of a party to a suit, and such ’

cognitor was to all intents and purposes identified with his
principal, 4 ξ 83.

Furthermore, the manager of a shop (institor), and captain of a
ship were enabled by praetorian legislation to bind the employer
and shipowner (exer-citor) to third parties by means of the actions
institoria and exercitoria, 4 ᾗ 71. This was giadually extended so
as to allow to all persons who contracted with an agent a right of
action, called quasi institoria, against his employer.

The praetors went even beyond the precedent furnished by insti-
toria, and allowed to principals a converse or obverse immediate
right of action against third parties who had contracted with
agents. Quod procurator ex re domini, mandato non refragante,
stipulatur, invito procuratore dominus petere potest, Dig. 3, 3, 68.
‘ When an agent, dealing with the interests of his principal and in
accordance with his instructions, makes a contract, the consent
of the agent is not required to entitle the principal to sue.' When
the praetors, proceeding by timid and hesitating steps, had reached
this point, the Roman law of agency had become identical with
the system we find established in modern Europe. Under this
system it is a general rule, that when an agent is duly constituted
and discloses the name of his principal, so as to enable the party
with whom he deals to have recourse to the principal, and contracta
in his name and on his behalf, and does not exceed his authority,
the principal is responsible and not the agent. The only reservation
to be made is the following: In contracte governed by J us gentium
the relation of Agency was recognized in its fullest development:
in Formal contracte, or contracts governed by the Civil law (of
which in the last period of Roman J urisprudence the only surviving
instance was Stipulatio), the primitive law, ignoring Agency, had
so far left its traces, that the principal could not sue or be sued on
the contracts of his Agent by actio Directa, but only by actio
Utilis3 that is, by a formula involving, by permission of the‘
judicature, a certain amount of Fictitious supposition. See above,
ᾗ 103.
