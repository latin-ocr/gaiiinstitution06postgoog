civil invalidity when the grounds of civil invalidity were merely‘

dueed by the praetor under the name of Bonorum possessi0, some-
times beside, and sometimes instead of, civilis hereditas, may be
divided into testate succession and intestate succession. The latter
branch (bonorum possessio intestati) was firmly established at an
earlier period than the former (bonorum possessio secundum tabu-
las). 'I'he rescript of Marcus Aurelius, mentioned by Gaius, may
be regarded as having definitively established the validity of the
praetorian testament3 in other words, as having raised in respect of
validity bonorum possessio testati to the level of bonorum possessio

1111512ῗεῖἐὲ origin Bonorum possessio was probably only the pro-

visional or interimistic possession granted to one of the parties
in a suit of Hereditatis petitio. This suit was a species of Real
aetion (vindicatio), and in all Real actions it is neeessary to deter-
mine which of the litigants shall have possession during the
pendency of the litigation. In the earliest period, that of statute-
proeess (legis actio), the interim possession was called vindiciae, and
the praetor who assigned it to one of the parties was said vindicias
dicere. In making the grant of vindiciae he was probably governed
by the same rule which afterwards prevailed when the question
of interim possession was determined by application of the Inter-
dicts Utrubi and Uti possidetis: that is to say he probably allowed
the party in actual possession to continue in possession. But this
rule was inapplicable to the case of Hereditatis petitio, for at the
decease of the proprietor who leaves an inheritance not one of the
claimants to succeed is in actual possession. Here accordingly the
grant was governed by different principles: if a will, prima faeie
valid, was propounded, possession was granted to the claimant
under the will (bonorum possessio secundum tabulas): if no will
was propounded possession was granted to the civil heirs (bonorum
possessio ab intestato), the self-successor or descendant (suus heres)
being preferred to the agnates or collaterals (legitimi). At a later
