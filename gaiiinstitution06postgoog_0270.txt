5152. Heredes autem aut ne-
cessarii dicuntur aut sui et neces-
sarii aut extranei.

§ 153. Necessariae heres est ser·
vus cum libertate heres institutus;
ideo sic appellatus, quia, sive velit
sive nolit, omnimodo post mortem
testatoris protinus liber et heres

ἕ 154. Unde qui facultates suas
suspectas habet, solet servum primo
aut secundo vel etiam ulteriore
gradu liberum et heredem instituere,
ut si creditoribus safis non fiat,
potius huius heredis quam ipsius
testatoris bona veneant, id est ut
ignominia quae accidit ex vendi-
tione bonorum hunc potius heredem
quam ipsum testatorem contingat;
quamquam aput Fufidium Sabino
placeat eximendum eum esse igno-
minia, quia non suo vitio, sed ne-
cessitate iuris bonorum venditionem

‘ pateretur. sed alio mre utimur.

5155. Pro hoc tamen incom-
modo illud ei commodum prae·-
statur, ut ea quae post mortem
patroni sibi adquisierit, sive ante
bonorum venditionem sive postea,
ipsi reserventur. et quamvis pro
portione bona venierint, iterum ex
hereditaria causa bona eius non ve-
nient, nisi si quid ei ex hereditaria
causa fuerit adquisitum, velut si

pro portionis, si quid postea adqui-

ἕ 152. Successore are necessary,
sels-successore aud necessary, or
external.

ξ 153. A necessary successor is a
slave enfranchised and instituted
heir, so called because,wi11ing or
un ,without any alternative,
on the death of the testator he im·

mediately has his freedom and the ³

succeoeion.

ς 154. For when a man’s affairs
are embarrassed, it is common for a
slave, either in the first place or as
a substitute in the second or any
inferior place, to be enfranchised
and appointed heir, so that, if the
creditore are not paid in full, the
heir is insolvent instead of the
testator, and the ignominy of in-
solvency attaches to the heir in-
stead of the testator3 though, as
Fufidius relates, Sabinus held that
he ought to be exempted from
ignominy, as it is not his own
fault, but legal compulsion, that
makes him insolvent; this, how-
ever, is not the law.

§ 155. To compensate this dis-
advantage he has the advantage
that his acquisitione aster the death
of his patron, and whether before
or aster the sale, are for his own
benefit‚ and although a portion
only of the debts is satisfied by the
sale, he is not liable to a second
sale of his after- acquired property
for the debts of the testator, unleoe
he gain anything as heir, if he in·
herit, for instance, the property of
a Latinus J umanus another freed·
man of the testator; whereas other
persons, who only pay a dividend,

on subsequently acquiring any pro-
perty‚ are liable to repeated sales.
