24 PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS.

Not only do Tit-les change3 the Rights and obligations linked
to these Titles are transformed in their fundamental conception. A
glance at the law (1) of Family, (2) of Property‚ (3) of Succession,
(4)· of Obligation will convince us of this.

(1) The loss by paterfamilias of the power of life and death over
wife and children was an essential change in Manus and Patria
potestas. The introduction of tutor dativus and tutor Atilianus did
not affect the nature of Guardianship: but its change from a private
right (jus ac potestas) to a public duty was a transformation of its
essence.

(2) The abolition of Mancipatio and In jure cessio and the exten·
sion of the period of Usucapio did not change the idea of Ownership3
but at an earlier period society was revolutionized when common
ownership was superseded by private ownersbip.

(3) The substitution of written instead of oral wills, and the
introduction of military or privileged wills, did not change the
nature of the right of Testation: but the earlier change from the
Comitial to the Mancipatory will was essential ; for whereas before
to exclude intestato devolution an act of the legislature was required,
afterwards a solemn Disposition by a private individual sufficcd.
Again, the nature of a universal 'Prust (fidei-commissum) instituted
by the Senatus-consultum Trebellianum was not essentially changed
by the Sc. Pegasianum: but the introduction of Codicils was an
essential change in testation3 for it introduced partial dispositione
in a sphere where formerly the legislator only permittcd universal
dispositione. And J ustinian’s benefice of inventory, entirely '
changing the character of the heres, was another fundamental
change in hereditary succession.

(4) Promises assumed a new character at the prehistorie period
when they passed from the moral to the legal code 3· and after the
historic period obligations continued to be modified in proportion
as· the growing ascendency of aequitas over jus strictum enabled the
tribunale to conform more closely to the presumable intentione of
a wise legislature. But the most remarkable innovation in this
department was the modern invention of paper obligations (papers
payable to the bearer or holder), whereby obligation, otherwise
incapable of detachment from the person of the original creditor,
became as transferrible from creditor to creditor as property is from
proprietor to proprietor. (See Ibering‚ Geist des Roemischen rechts,
ou the variability of the institutions of the civil code.)
