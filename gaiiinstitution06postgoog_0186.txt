superior from using and dealing with certain things as it may
please.

Of things subject to public dominion, some are vested immediately
in the state, others in subordinate personS, single or corporate,
magistra-tes, for instance, and municipalities, to be held by such
persons for various public purpose& Among these we may reckon
res divinae which are portions of public dominion vested in certain
corporations in trust for religious purposes.

Another division of res publicae is into res in patrimonio populi
and res non in patrimonio populi. Under the former 616 included
the public treaffliry, the public domain, public slaves, escheats
(caduca) or res privatae that relapse to the state by forfeiture, or
as ultimus heres 3 in other words, 611 11111136 of which the state as
universitas retains not only the property but also the use and
disposition (quasi propriae et privatae res universitatis, Dig. 43, 8,
2, 4). The other class includes, high 166116, public rivers, public
buildings, &c., that is, all things of which the property is in the
community and the use in the members of the community. Or

Not only res publicae but res privatae may be subject to this sort
of personal servitude. For instance, the banks of public rivers 61111
1116 trees thereupon are the property of the adjacent proprietors:
but the navigators of these rivers have the right of mooring,
1611111113, 111116111113, and using the banks ·in various other wayS,

Property absolute or pre-eminently so called, may be defined 66

indefinite enjoyment or use, and a power of aliening from 611 who
in default of alienation by him might succeed by descent 3 or, in
other words, from all successors interposed between himself 61111 1116
sovereign as ultimus heres. It is accordingly sometimes said to ’
consist of jus utendi, fruendi, abutendi3 where abusus includes the
power of consumption or destruction, of dereliction, and of dis-
position (sale, exchange, gift, 1116113636, 16666, 816). Another
clement is equally important, the right of exclusion (jus pro-
bibendi).

Besides absolute property Roman law recognizes various kinds of
partial property, real rights over a subject of which the dominion
