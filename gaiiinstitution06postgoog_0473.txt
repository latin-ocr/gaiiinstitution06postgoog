111. ξ 182.] Ο. Ex DELIC'PO. 451

In hereditatis petitio effects a and b are made by Sc. J uventianum
to date not from litis contestatio, but from a still earlier period, the
moment of Insinuatio.

(c) Litis contestatio in actiones stricti juris fixes the moment to
be regarded in the valuation of the plaintiff ’ s interest in the subject
of dispute (litis aestimatio). In bona fide actions this date is given
by the moment of Condemnatio. See 4 ξ 51.

4. Litis contestatio affecte the character of the Subject of liti-

gation, which it converts into res Litigiosa, thereby rendering
unlawful its alienation by the plaintiff or defendant. See 4 § 117.

All actions are founded on the violation of some right, that is
to say, on a wrong or delict. Even actions on contract are founded
on a wrong, namely‚ on a breach of contract, and the plaintiff
recovers not his primary right but a sanctioning right, in whatever
measure it may be awarded. Delict (delictum, maleficium), how-
ever, is generally used in a more limited sense, to signify any wrong
or unlawful act other than a breach of convention. Breach of con-
tract is the violation of a jus in personam, or right available against
a determinate person: delict i'n the narrower sense is a violation of
a jus in rem, or rightavailable against all the world. J us in rem
includes not only property and servitude but also rights of status,
and what we have called primordial rights, e. g. the right to liberty,
security, health, honour, reputation, for these rights can be main-
tained not against certain persons only but against all mankind.

Delicts or wrongs have a further division, into public and private.
Public wrongs are called crimes, private wrongs are called tres-
passes, or torts, or civil injuries. Crimes have been defined to be
such unlawful acts as are injurious in the first instance to the State3
civil injuries, such as are harmful, principally or exclusively, to

private individuale. But this definition is not satisfactory, because
