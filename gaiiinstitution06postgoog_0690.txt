668 ADDENDUM.

which they welded into their substance were neither consistently
regarded nor consistently disregarded. (A) Sometimes they were
regarded in spite of the inconvenience they occasioned: (B) some-
times convenience prevailed: the new institute acquired an inde-
pendent position3 and logie and archaeology were set at defiance.

(A) The form of J udicial sui-render could not be employed for the
acquisition of property by the agency of an inferior (son or slave)
because such a person could not be a plaintiff in a genuine vindi-
catio. Hence the inferior could be an instrument for acquir-ing
a rustic servitude, because he could be a party to a mancipation,
but not for acquiring an urban servitude, because this could only
be conveyed by J udicial surrender, 2 ᾧ 29.

In Mancipatio the payment by bars of bronze was as fictitious
as the apprehensio or taking possession3 and yet it sufficed to
satisfy the requirement of the Twelve Tables whereby in Sale and

The disqualification was continued, in spite of the inconvenienee
it would occasion, when the familiae emptor was a mere fiction;
and, what is more extraordinary, legatees and persons united to the
true successor were admissible as witnesses although the policy of
the legislator was thereby entirely defeated (totum jus tale contur-
batum fuerat, Inst. 2, 10, 10).

(Β) In the following instances on the contrary the laws of the
simulated institution were disregarded. Hereditatis petitio being
a form of Vindicatio we might have expected that any kind of ·
inheritance when once vested would be transferable by J udicial
surrender or fictitious vindication, just as any form of inheritance
could be litigated by genuine hereditatis petitio. But we find that
only the intestate succession of a collateral (legitima hereditas)
could be thus conveyed, and this only before it had vested ΒΥ aditio
in the alienor, 3 ᾧ 85.
