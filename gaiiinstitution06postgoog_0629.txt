lv. §§ 115—137.] BURDEN ΟΡ PROQF. 607

does not exclude the jus naturale of the proprietor, and prescription
of pendency leaves a debtor subject to naturalis obligatio,

In respect of the burden of proof (onuS, necessitas probationis) the
following are the leading rules:

The party who asserts a right must prove it: Ei incumbit pro-
batio qui dicit non qui negat, Dig. 22, 3, 2. Hence the plaintiff,
as a general rule, must prove the intentio: Semper necessitas pro-
bandi incumbit illi qui agit, Dig. 22, 3, 21 : Actore non probante,
qui convenitur, etsi nihil ipse praestat, obtinebit, Cod. 2, 1, 4: and
the defendant must prove the exceptio: In exceptionibus dicendum
est reum partibus actoris fungi oportere, ipsumque exceptionem
velut intentionem implere, Dig. 22, 3, 19, pr.

But, further, in the second line of defence the proof of the
matter alleged in avoidance is incumbent on the defendant: ut
creditor, qui pecuniam petit numeratam, implere cogitur, ita rursum
debitor, qui solutam affirmat, ejus rei probationem praestare debet,
Cod. 4, 19, 1. In a passage of the Digest this rule is combined
with the preceding: Secundum generalem regulam, quae eos qui
opponendas esse exceptiones adfirmant, vel solvisse debita conten-
dunt, haec ostendere exigit, Dig. 22, 3, 25, 2.

Moreover in the first line of defence, when it assumes the
form of a confession and avoidance3 e. g. an averment of the
lunacy of a testator ς in other words, when it is contended that
a disposition, in consequence of some exceptional circumstance,
had not the validity which the law presumes3 the proof of this
avoiding allegation is on the defendant, Cod. 6, 36, 5. Bethmann·
Hollweg, Q 109.

In the middle ages the true exceptio or counteractive plea was
called exceptio juris: the first line of defence, when it assumed
the form of an avoidance, and the second line of defence, what-
ever its special nature, were called inappropriately exceptio sacti.
This shows that the true nature of exceptio had been forgotten:
the similarity‚ however, of the three lines of defence in respect
of the burden of proof is probably the reason why they were all
called exceptio.

The necessity of disclosing by the pleadings whether the de·
fendant relies on the first or second line of defence, e. g. whether
he denies that a debt ever existed, or maintains that it was ex-
tinguished, in order to save the plaintiff from being taken by
surprise (for which disclosure there was no provision in procedure
