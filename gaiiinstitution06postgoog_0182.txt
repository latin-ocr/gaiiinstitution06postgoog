160 DE REBUs smeums. [11. §5 1-14.

rently, have no determinate subject, corporeal or incorporeal, to
which they are correlated. In a right to the services of a menial
or gladiator, for instance, it would be hard to indicate any subject
or secondary object to which the obligation of the menial or
gladiator relates.

It is clear that no division of Subjects of right will coincide with
a classification of Rights: while, if we divide Res in the meta-
physical sense of the World, or Being, or Existence (a sense sug-
gested by the differentiae, corporalis, and incorporalis), Dominion,
like all other rights, will be a member of the branch res incor-
poralis, Gaius, however, wishes us to identify Dominion with res
corporalis, and to make Obligation and the fractions of Domi-
nion (servitutes), and even some forms of Dominion (e.g. hereditas),
members of the contra-distinguished branch, res incorporalis. (Cf. 3
ξ 83, omnes ejus res incorporales et corporales quaeque ei debita
sunt.)

Gaius was probably not entirely responsible for this confusion of
thought, which, perhaps, was too deeply inwoven in the formulae
of Roman jurisprudence to be easily eliminated by an institutional
writer. E.g. the declaration (intentio) of a real action (in rem
actio) was of the form: Si paret (1) illum fundum—(2) illam
hereditatem—actoris esse. (Cf. 4 ἕ 3. In rem actio est cum
aut corporalem rem intendimus nostram esse aut jus aliquod
nobis competere.) Now as hereditas is a J'us successionis (2 § 14),
it is clear that, if the second formula is correct, the first formula
ought to be, not, Si paret illum fundum—but, Si paret illius
fundi proprietatem—actoris esse. To meet this and similar
inaccuraoies of the framers of the formularieS, Gaius is misled
into identifying in res corporalis two things completely disparate,
Right and the Subject of a right. There is a similar confusion
in English law, chattels, tenements, and hereditaments being
sometimes used to denote the subjecte, movable or immovable, of
certain rights, sometimes the rights over those subjects: and just
as Res is divided into Corporalis and Incorporalis, so Heredita-
ments are divided into Corporeal and Incorporea13 although, if
‘ the term denotes a right, both branches are equally incorporeal:
if it denotes the subject of a right, both branches are equally
corporeal.

In order to distribute the world of rights minus the rights of
statue, and to indicate the position held by Dominion in the system
