lv. §§ loa-109] EXCEPTIO REI IUDICATAE. 579

of delivery of possession, is not barred by exception from bringing
another real action, expressly limited, like the former, to a specific
title.'

Extinctive (ipso jure) consumption of a right of action vanished Ϊ
with the formulary system, and in J ustinian’s time the averment of ἕ

Res judicata is only found under the form of Exceptio or a Counter-
active plea. Indeed, when the judex pedaneus of the republican
period ceased to be commissioned to hear and determine causes,
one of the conditions of Extinctive litis consumptio (unus judex,
ξ 107), was always of necessity wanting.

But this was not the only change: the consumption of a right
of action by the operation of Res in judicium deducta, whether as
an extinctive (ipso jure) or a counteractive plea (ope exceptionis);
in other words, necessary Novation operated ‚by Litis contestatio,

was also abrogated and is not to be found in the statute-book of '¹

J ustinian. Even the operation of Res judicata, so far as it was
governed by the same rules as Res in judicium deducta and merely
indicated by its name a later stage of the proceedings (sententia
lata) may also be said to have been abolished. 'Phe ruleS, that is
to say, which governed the transformed Exceptio rei judicatae, as
it prevailed in the time of Justinian, were much more rational and
flexible than the hard and fast doctrine of Necessary novation
whether by Litis Contestatio or by Sententia lata which prevailed
in the time of Statute-process, ᾗ 108, and apparently survived to
the days of Gaius. As the grounds of the judicial decision (ra-
tiones decidendi, denoting here rather the minor premisses or facts
established in favour of the plaintiff or defendant, than the major
premiss or law relating to those facts) were taken into con-
sideration before the Exceptio rei judicatae was allowed to operate,
a plaintiff who lost his cause in consequence of Plus petitio or some
dilatory plea or by consumption of process (duration of suit for
eighteen months, or termination of praetorship) was no longer
held to have eternally forfeited his claim: but suitors were merely
restrained, in accordance with the real object of the institution,
from harassing their opponents with renewed litigation on the
precise questions that had once been adequately decided. 'Phe
operation of the plea was not less powerful nor less extensive
but made more completely conformable to equity. Savigny,
ξᾷ 280-301.
