1v. §§ 138-170.] DERIVATIVE POSSESSION. 645

e. g. ususfructus, usus, fructus, were protected, according to cir-
cumstances, by Uti possidetis, Utrubi, or Unde vi, with a special
differentiation, which constituoed them interdicta utilia, Vat. fr. 90.

Four of the cases we have mentioned, the possession of the
emphyteuta, the mortgagee, the sequestrator, and the permissive
holder, are anomalous3 for possession is composed of two elements,
physical detention and the purpose of exercising rights of owner·
ship (animus domini), and none of these four possessors can be said
to have the animus domini. In these four cases, and these alone,
it is necessary to assume that the law recognized a derivative or
transferred possession, in which one of the elements of original
possession, the animus domini, is absent, and replaced by what may
be called the animus alienam possessionem exercendi.

In three of the above-mentioned cases usucapion-possession re·
mained with the proprietor (the dominus agri emphyteuticarii, the
mortgagor, the grantor of precarious tenancy), and only interdict-

possession passed to the derivative possessor (the emphyteuta, the
mortgagee, the grantes of precarious tenancy). In all the four cases

(including sequestration) the dominus lost the protection of the inter- ³
diets Retinendae possessionis, which were transferred to the derivative ⁴

possessors. The grantor of precarious tenancy was protected, however,
by the interdict De precario, an interdict Recuperandae pomssionis.

The Superficiarius (holder of a Real right (jus in re) to a house
of which an owner of the ground is proprietor, e. g. a person who
with permission οξ the landowner has built out of his own materiale
a house on another person’s land) has, according to Savigny, only
juris quasi-possessio: but this is inconsistent with the fact that
he is protected by the interdicte Unde vi and De precario, Dig. 43,
16, 1, 5. According to Vangerow he has Derivative possession
like the four above mentioned: but this is inconsistent with the
fact that he is protected by the special interdict De superficiebus,
while the owner of the soil retains the protection of Uti possidetis,
Dig. 43, 17, 3, 7, which in Derivative possession is transferred to
the Derivative possessor. 'I'he true doctrine, then, appears to be
that Superficiarius has Original possession of the house, though
the landlord has possession of the soil, Baron, ξ 188.

As possession consists of two elements, one corporeal and one
mental, it is evident that it cannot be acquired by a purely mental
act„ Adipiscimur possessionem corpore et animo, neque per se
animo aut per se corpore, Dig. 41, 2, 3, 1. ‘ We acquire possession
