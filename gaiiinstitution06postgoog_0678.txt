et rei, et ideo jurare debent non calumniae causa litem intendere,
et non calumniae causa infitias ire, Dig. 10, 23 44, 4. ‘In par·
tition of inheritance‚ dissolution of joint ownership, and tracing of
boundarieS, both parties are equally plaintiff and defendant, and
therefore must swcar to the good saith of both the suit and the
defence.'

In the time of J ustinian the action of calumny‚ the Contrary
action, sponsio and restipulation had become obsoleto, and in
their place the losing party was condemned in costs, and the
oath received development, being always administered to both
parties and their advocates, Sed pro his introductum est et prae-
fatum jusjurandum et ut improbus litigator etiam damnum et
impensas litis inferre adversario suo cogatur, Inst. 4, 16, 10. ‘ In-
stead of the old checks the oath of the parties and their counsel has
been introduced, aud the condemnation of the unsuccessful litigant
in the costs of his adversary.' Patroni autem causarum, qui utrique
parti suum praestantes auxilium ingrediuntur, quum lis fuerit con·
testata, post narrationem propositam et contradictionem objectam

. . . sacrosanctis evangeliis tactis juramentum praestent, quod
omni quidem virtute sua omnique ope, quod verum et justum
existimaverint, clientibus suis inferre procurabunt, nihil studii re-

linquentes quod sibi possibile est3 non autem, credita sibi causa
cognita quod improba sit vel penitus desperata et ex mendacibus

allegationibus composita, ipsi scientes prudentesque mala conscientia
liti patrocinabuntur3 sed et si certamine procedente aliquid tale
sibi cognitum fuerit, a causa recedent, ab hujusmodi communione
sese penitus separanteS, Cod. 3, 1, 14. ‘ 'Phe counsel at the com-

mencement of the hearing, after the exposition of the bill and,
answer, shall touch the holy Gospels and swear to do their utmost
sor their clients as far as they believe their cause to be just, but not
knowingly to support the wrong, and if in the course of the pro-
ccedings they should change their opinion, to retire from the
cause.’

ξ 184. Vadimonium, cautiqjudicio sisti, must be distinguished
from the security judicatum solvi. It only referred Ψωφὶς
in jure, and was required whenever there was an adjournment,
whereas security judicatum solvi was only required from the de-
fendant in real actions and in certain exceptional personal actions,
