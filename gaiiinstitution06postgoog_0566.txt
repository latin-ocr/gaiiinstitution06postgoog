be divested ΒΥ a mere change of domicil: by settling, that is to
say, in a new domicil where majority comes later.

'Phe validity of the Form of any disposition (contract, marriage,
testament, Sec.) depende on the law by which the substance of the
disposition is governed (the law of the stipulated place of perform-
ance, the law of the husband's domicil, the law of the testator's
domicil at the time of making his will). But inconveniences would
arise if this law were exclusive. For instance, a Prussian will
can only be made with the assistance of a court. In France no
court is authorized to give its assistance to the execution of a will,
which is the function of the Notary. A Prussian, then, domiciled
in Prussia but dying 1n France, would be unable to execute a will
if he could only do it in the form prescribed by Prusa-ian law.
Accordingly, as an alternative to the law that governs the disposi-
tion, the law of the place where the disposition ιε made is accepted.
and the form of a dispositionis valid if it satisfiae either the proper
law of the disposition or the law of the territory in which the dis-
position is made. The applicability of the latter law is expreoeed
by the maxim: Locus regit actum. We must except the forms of
Alienation which must always satisfy the lex rei Sitae.

Procedure is governed by the law of the forum where a suit is
instituted. Dilatory exceptions, accordingly, as based merely on
rules of procedure, depend on the law of the forum. But the
material contentions of the defence, that ia, the rights of the de-
fendant, whether ipso jure extinctive, or per exceptionem peremp-
toriam counteractive, of the rights of the plaintiff, are governed by
the same law as the rights of the plaintiff ; that is ΒΥ the local law
that governs the obligation. 'I'he Exceptio Sc. Macedoniani and Sc.
Velleiani, however, as relating to personal Capacity, are governed
by the law of the domicil of the person in question.

Procedure in Bankruptcy being a partial or imperfect Execution,
its leading feature, the Classification or marshalling of creditore,
like other matters of Procedure, is governed by the law of the Forum
ΒΥ which the execution is superintended, which in this case will be
the law of the domicil of the Insolvent. The priorities of the
purely personal creditore, that is to say, will be governed by the
law of the forum: but where there are hypothecary creditore who
hold mortgages over property of the insolvent in other landa, their
priorities involving a question of Real rights will depend on the lex
rei Sitne· The preliminary Proof by the creditors of their particular
