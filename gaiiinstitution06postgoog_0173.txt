of the positive code. Moreover, the law of guardianship has been
most variable, not only if we look to different countries, but also if
we look at different periods in the same country3 and the praetor
or chancellor 01 other authority that 1166 ‚had the supervision of
guardians has always exercised a great latitude of discretion3
features which again forbid us to ascribe the 16166 of wardship to
any comparatively immutable code of nature. A striking illustra-
tion and proof of the civil character of the 16166 of wardship in
Roman law is furnished by the fact that though a promise by a
ward without 1116 guardian's authority has no binding force, i. 6.
produces 110 civilis obligatio, 111 other terms is not actionable,
except so far 66 116 16 thereby enriched3 yet, irrespectively of the
gain or loss of the ward, Roman jurisprudence recognized that his
promise produced a naturalis obligatio, for it ruled that such pro· x
mise might be the basis of a suretyship, 3 ᾧ 119, and might extin-
guish a previous debt by novation, 3 ᾧ 176; and both suretyship 1
and novation are institutione which are essentially accessary3 that
is to say, each implies the existence of two distinct obligatione,
either civil or natural, one assuring and the other assured, or one
transforming and the other transformed. If wardship had been
regarded 66 6 natural or gentile institution, then the promise of
the ward, having no validity by the gentile code (naturalis obli-
gatio), would have been incapable of being confirmed by suretyship
or transformed by novation.

In integrum restitutio, 6 branch of the praetor' s equitable juris-
diction, and one of the most remarkable cases of his cognitio extra-
ordinaria, has been mentioned more than once, and deserves here 6
brief explanation. Restituere in 6 general sense denotes any un-
doing of 6 wrong, any replacement of 6 person or 1116 right in his
or its original condition, whether by the voluntary act of the
wrongdoer, or after action brought, and then either at the invi-
tation of the judge (in virtue of the clause, ni restituat, 4 ᾧ 47), or
in execution of 6 judicial sentence. But in the phrase we 616
examining it denotes the act, not of 6 private party, but of a
judicial authority. In integrum restitutio is the restitution by the
praetor of a person or his right to his or its original uninjured con-
dition, in cases when no remedy is to be obtained either from the
rigorous mles of the civil law or jus strictum (e. g. by civilis actio),
or even from equity as administered by the ordinary judges in the
ordinary forms (6. g. by exceptio or bonae fidei actio). The inter-
