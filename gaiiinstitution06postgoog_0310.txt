administratiom and bequeathed the net residue of his patrimony
to the real object of his bounty as legatee (legatarius). When
this course was restricted by the lex Falcidia, a testator who wished
a certain donee to receive the whole of his patrimony free from
burdens would institute another person as beree, subject to a trust
to transfer the whole of the inheritance, after payment of debts
and with some remuneration for his trouble, to the beneficiary
donee (fideicommissarius). At first the testator could only rely
on the honour of the heres, for these trusts were not legally bind-
ing-3 and not long after they became legally binding they were
subJeeted by Sc. Pegasianum to the same restrictione as were im-
posed on legacies. Thus the advantage of having a disinterested
Executor‚ of leaving the testator's wishes to be carried into effect
by a person not, like the successor oi· legatee, interested in delayed
or inequitable distribution 3 an advantage which an English testator
may, if he chooses, secure, was deliberately sacrificed by the Roman
legislator.

Another method of leaving to a person the net value of an in-
heritanee without the troubles of administration, viz, the institution
of the slave os the devisee‚ has already been noticed.

The conversion of a moral into a politieal obligation by the
legalization of truste, was similar to what occurred when the
Twelve Tables gave legal force to the nuncupation declaring the
conditions and purposes of a mancipation3 and, remembering
the celebrated ordinance, Cum nexum faxit mancipiumque, uti
lingua nuncupassit‚ ita jus esto, it may occur to us to wonder why
Augustus did not imitate the energetic brevity of the ancient legis·
lator, and simply enact‚ Cum testamentum faxit codicillosve, uti
fideicommiserit‚ ita jus esto. There would then have been no need
of the cumbrous machinery of fictitious sales and stipulatione be·
tween quasi vendor and quasi vendee3 but a little reflection will
show that such an enactment would have operated very incon-
· veniently‚ and have defeated the very purposes for which truste

were instituted. Such an enactment would have made trusts, like
nuncupations‚ a matter of civil law3 and the jus strictum of the
civil law was far from elastic or rational even in the time of
Augustus3 so that, if it was intended to enlarge the powers of
testatore and the discretion of the fiduciary tribunal, it was abso-
lutely necessary to make trusts a province not of legal but of
equitable jurisdiction.
