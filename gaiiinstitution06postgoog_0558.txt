536 DE Aomomssns [ιν. §§ 45-52.

(2) The Date of valuation, or time at which the value of the
specifie thing due from the defendant was estimated, depended on
the nature of the aetion. As a general rule the date of valuationin
stricti juris actions was the date of Litis contestatiO, in Bona fide

τ’ and Real actions the date of condemnatio, Dig. 13, 6, 3, 2. But

if a date for performance had been fixed in a contract that date was
the date of valuation, Dig. 13, 3, 4. Again if the defendant had
been guilty of Mora, the plaintiff had his election between any of
these dates and the date of Mora, Dig. 19, 1, 3, 3, Dig. 17, 1, 37.
The foregoing only relates to Real actions and Personal actions
grounded on Dispositions (contracts and quasi-eontracts): in per-
sonal actions grounded on Delict, the date of valuation was the
date of delict, the date, in other word s ‚ of the inception of ob-
ligation.

These different dates for valuation were expressed in the formula
by a different wording of the condemnatio. In Real actions, § 51,
and in Bona fide actions, ᾧ 47, where the date was the date of
passing judgment or condemnation, the formula contained the
wordst quanti ea res erit ; in deliets where the date of valuation
was the date of delict, it contained the words: quanti ea res fuit,
Dig. 9, 2, 2. No traces exist of the formula employed in Con-
dietions whose time of estimation was the time of Litis contestatio;
but there can be little doubt that it contained the words: quanti ea
res est, Savigny, ᾧ 275.

It has already been mentioned, 3 ᾧ 212, that the valae asseoeed
was not the market value of the thing but its value to the plaintiff,
and included mediate as well as immediate value.

In the legislation of J ustinian the rules respecting litis aestimatio
were of less importanee, because the condemnatio was in many cases.
no longer pecuniary but commanded the conveyance of property
(dare), delivery of possession (tradere), restitution (restituere), or
production (exhibere), of the specific thing itself that was the
original subject of litigation. 'Phe defendant was no longer invited,
as in the aetio arbitraria of the formulary system, but compelled
by the armed force of the state, to make specific delivery or re·
stitution. Qui restituere jussus judici non paret, contendens non
posse se restituere, siquidem habet rem, manu militari officio judicis
ab eo possessio transfertur, et fructuum duntaxat omnisque causae
