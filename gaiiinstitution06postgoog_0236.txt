out this cession of actions, by bringing a utilis actio, i.e. a fictitious
action, or action which seigned that the cession had taken place, or
rather, that the principal had been the immediate contractor, not
represented ΒΥ an agent. But this fiction was only required in
respect of cont-racts governed by principles of civil law, i. e. the
Forma} contracte, of which at last the only instance was stipulatio.
In Formless contracte, or contracte governed by jus gentium, the
agent was a mere conduit pipe; the principal acquircd an immediate
right or obligation, without Cession and without Fiction. Ea quae
civiliter adquiruntur, per eos qui in potestate nostra sunt adqui-
rimus, veluti stipulationem3 quod naturaliter adquiritur, sicuti est
possessio, per quemlibet, volentibus nobis possidere, adquirimus,
Dig. 41, 1, 53. ‘ Rights obtained by civil titles can only be
acquired by the mediation of persons in our power 3 for instance,
rights by stipulatione rights obtained ΒΥ natural titles, such as
the right of possession, are acquirable through any agent that we
choose to employ.’ See 3 ᾧ 163, to which place this topic more
properly belongs.

§96. We might have expected that, as inferiors can acquire
sor their superiore ΒΥ MancipatiO, 2 ᾦ 87, so they could also acquire
ΒΥ In jure cessio, especially as the same form of words: Hunc ego
hominem ex jure Quiritium meum esse aio: was used in Manci-
patio, 1 ᾗ 119, and in Vindicatio, 4 ᾗ 16. It seems, however, that
in Mancipatio the formula could be changed to: Hanc rem cx
jure Quiritium Lucii Titii domini mei esse aio, 3 ξ 167; and that
a similar modification was not admissible in the legis actio. It
follows that an inferior (filius, mancipium, or servus) could acquire
for his superior rural servitudes, but not urban or personal servi-
tudes, 2 § 29, 303 not, that is to say, as res singulae: for as parts
of a rerum universitas these and all other rights could be acquired
for a superior by an inferior by making aditio of an hereditas
with the sanction of the superior, 2 ξ 188; and even as res singulae
these rights could bc acquired for a superior by an inferior ΒΥ title
of legatum3 that is, if they are conferred by a testator on the in-
ferior as legatarius, Vat. frag. 51 .

As a Rerum universitas includes Obligations (res incorporalis),
active and passive, as well as Dominion (res corporalis), the con-
sideration of Obligation should, theoretically speaking, precede the
consideration of Rerum universitas; in an elementary exposition
like the present, however, no practica} inconvenienec is occasioned
