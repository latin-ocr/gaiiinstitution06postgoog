DE MULIERUM TUTRLA.

§ 189. Sed inpuberes quidem in
tutela esse omnium civitatium iure
contingit3 quia id naturali rationi
conveniens est, ut is qui perfectae
aetatis non sit alterius tutela rega-
tur. nec fere ulla civitas est, in qua
non licet parentibus liberis suis in-
puberibus testamento tutorem dare3
quamvis, ut supra diximus, soli
cives Romani videantur tantum
liberos in potestate habere.

§190. Feminas vero perfectae
aetatis in tutela esse fere nulla pre-
tiosa ratio suasisse videtur. nam
quae vulgo creditur, quia levitate
animi plerumque decipiuntur, et
aequum erat eas tutorum auctori-
tate regi, magis speciosa videtur
quam vera. mulieres enim quae
perfectae aetatis sunt ipsae sibi
.· negotia tractant, et in quibusdam
ἒ causis ,ῥέῃ-310110 tutor interponit
auctoritatem suam; saepe etiam
invitus auctor fieri a praetore co-

gitur.

ξ 191. Unde cum tutore nullum
ex tutela iudicium mulieri datur:
at ubi pupillorum pupillarumve
negotia tutores tractant, eis post
pubertatem tutelae iudicio ratio-
nem reddunt.

§ 192. Sane patronorum et pa-
rentum legitimae tutelae vim ali-
quam habere intelleguntur eo, quod

ᾗ 189. The wardship of children
under the age of puberty is pre-
scribed by every legislation, for it
10 a dictate of natural reason that
persons of immature years should
be under foreign guidance and con-
trol, and almost all states permit a
parent to nominate a testamentary
guardian for 1110 children under the
age of puberty, though, as we have
before stated, only citizens of Rome
appear to be invested with parental

ower.
P ξ 190. But why women of ma-
ture years should continue in ward-
ship there appears to be no valid
reason 3 for the common allegation‚
that their weakness of judgment
exposes them to the designa of the
fraudulent, and that humanity re-
quires them to be put under the
control and authority of a guar-
dian, seems rather specious than
true, for women above the age of
puberty administer their own pro-
perty, and it is a mere formality
that in some circumstances their

guardian interposes his assent3 in ·

many others, if he refuses, he may be
compelled to withdraw his opposi-
tion by an appeal to the praetor.

ξ 191. Accordingly, a guardian
is not suable on account of admi-
nistration by a woman in wardship ;
whereas the guardian of an infant,
male or female, is liable to be sued
on account of 1110 administration
as soon as the ward attains to
the age of puberty.
