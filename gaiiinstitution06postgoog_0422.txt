assumed, is called INTERVEN'HO. Si quum essem tecum contrae-
turus, mulier intervenerit ut cum ipsa potius contraham, videtur
intercessisse, Dig. 16, l, 8, 14.

B. Cumulative Intercession, or the addition of an obligation to an
obligation, is either Partial or Total, according as either part or the
whole of the object of the first obligation is the object of the second
or additional obligation.

(3) Of Partial intercessors we find an example within the limita
of Italy, in spossons and Fidepromissors under the operation of the
lex Furia. By this law the liability of each sponsor was in inverse
ratio to their number, ξ 121. Whether an Italian Sponsor who
had not availed himself of the limitation of his liability under the
lex Furia was entitled to Regressus under the older lex Apuleia,
was a matter of controversy, ibid.-

Total Intercession is divided, according as several debtors are
bound by one single obligation or several distinct, though similar,
obligations, into two classes, Correality and Solidarity.

Correality is subdivided into two classes, according as all the
debtors are equally principals and originally interested, or some are
principal and others only subsidiary or accessory.

Correality in which all the debtors are interested as principals
has no specific name, but bears in a distinctive meaning the generie
name of CORREALITY. As Intercession has been defined to be the
assumption of an alien debt (aliena obligatio), this Correality is
not a species of Intercession.

(4) Correality in which one debtor is principal and others are
accessory is instanced in FIDE-mssm. There is not only Correality
between the principal and each Fidejussor but also between the
several FidejussorS. This is denied by Savigny, Law of Obligations,
ᾧ 25, who asserts that though there is Correality between the
principal and each Fidejussor there is none between the several
Fidejussors: but Vangerow truly observeS, ξ 573, that if the obli-
gation of each Fidejussor is identical with the obligation of the
principa] it follows, by the fundamental axiom of syllogism, that
the obligations of the several Fidejussors are identieal with one
another: in other words, that there is Correality between the
several Fidejussors. Fidejussors have Beneficium divisionis by the
epistle of Hadrian, ξ 121, Beneficium excussionis by Novella 4 of
J ust1man and emptio nominis or Beneficium cedendamm actionum.
If he neglected to avail himself of these, a Fidejussor, like other
