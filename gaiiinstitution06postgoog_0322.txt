300 DE RERUM UNIVERSITATIBUS. [11. §§ 260-289.

ᾧ 264. J ustinian declares that the heir is not forthwith released
from his obligation by the owner’s refusal to sell, but will be bound
to seize any opportunity that may subsequently offer of purchasing
and manumitting the slave in pursuance of the trust, Inst. 2, 24, 2.

ᾧ 270. Codicils, according to J ustinian‚ first acquired legal
validity in the time of Augustus, who being trustee under a codicil
set the example of performing the trust. The jurist Trebatius
being consulted by Augustae, whether it was possible to give legal
force to codicils without defeating the policy of testamentary law,
gave a decided opinion in the affirmative ; and all scruples respecting
the validity of codicils vanished when it became known that· codicils
had been left by the eminent jurist Labe0.

Codicillus is the diminutive of codex, and denotes the less impor-

’ ‘²⁴ tant and solemn document-s or instruments of a man of business,

a pocket-book, an agenda‚· a codici13 as codex denotes the more
important and formal documentS, a journal, a ledger, a will. A
codicil enabled a testator who had solemnly executed a will to add
to or modify its dispositions without the necessity of re-execution.
It was usual in a will to ratify any prior or subsequent codicils;
a codicil, however, might exist without any will. An informal will
could only take effect as a codicil if such was the expressed inten-
tion of the testator. A codicil could not contain an institution or
disinheritance or substitution 3 but it might contain a trust for the
transfer of the whole of an inheritance: and though a codicil could
not contain a disinheritance, yet we have seen that a codicillary
Ι declaration that the successor was unworthy produced confiscation

or ereption of the inheritance for indignitas. A testator could only
leave a single will, for a later will revoked a former3 but he might
leave many codiciIS. A codicil needed no formalities, though J us-
tinian required the attestation of five witnesses, not, however, as an
essential solemnity, but as a means of proof ε for, in the absence of
five witnesses‚ the heir might be required to deny the existence of a
declaration of trust upon his oath, Inst. 2, 23, 12. The admission
of codicils was a departure from the rule requiring a unity in the act
of testation. The concentration of his last will in a single act
disposing simultaneously of the universal succession was no longer
required of the testator. He now might distribute his fortune in a
series of.fragmentary or piecemeal and unrelated dispositions.

§ 278. Fideicommissa were enforced by persecutio, or the prae-
tor’s extraordinaria cognitio,
