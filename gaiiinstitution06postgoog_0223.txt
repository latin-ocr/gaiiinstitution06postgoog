though the destruction of property
is a bar to a vinffieaffion, it is no

565. Tradition or transfer of possession, as we have seen, was
admitted in the civil law as a mode of transferring quiritary property
in¹ snch non-mancipable things as were corporeal: in mancipable
things it could only transfer bonitary property. In J ustinian’s
time 'I'radition had superseded Surrender in court and Mancipation;
and transfer of possession was the universal solemnity for transfer
of dominion.

If we consider Surrender, Mancipation‚ 'I'radition‚ we shall see
that they are only three forms of one identical title, Alienation.
'I'he substance or essence of the title, the intention on the one
side to transfer property, on the other to accept it, is the same in
all three3 it is only the adventitious or accidental or evidentiary
(3 ᾧ 92) portion of the title in which they differ.

Although delivery of possession, like the solemnities of mancipa-
tion and surrender, is, as compared with the will or intention of the
parties, only an evidentiary and symbolic part of the title, yet both
parcels, the external as well as the internal act, are indispensable in
the transfer of dominion. Traditionibus et usucapionibus dominia
rerum, non nudis pactiS, transferuntur, Cod. 2, 3, 20. ‘ Tradition,
and usucapion‚ not naked convention, operate a transfer of dominion.'
We have already noticed exceptions to this rule in the case of ser-
.vitus, hypotheca, societas, 1 ξ 31. Again, Nunquam nuda traditio
transfert dominium sed ita si venditio vel aliqua j usta causa prae-
cesserit propter quam traditio sequeretur, Dig. 41, 1, 31. ‘ Naked
delivery does not transfer property, but must be based on contract
of sale or some other sufficient inducement.' It is clear that mere
