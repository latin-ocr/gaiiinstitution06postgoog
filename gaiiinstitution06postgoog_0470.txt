J 448 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [111.§§ 168-181.

’ sumption of a right of action (litis consumptio) which has just been

described: the barring of any subsequent suit in virtue of the maxim:
De eadem re ne bis sit acti0, Quintilian, 7, 6,1‚ either ΒΥ extinction
(ipso jure) or by counteraction (ope exceptionis) of the plaintiff’s right
to sue. This occurred, as we shall see, 4- ᾧ 103, even when in conse·
quence of process-prescription there was no J udgment, or when, by
reason of Plus petitio or some dilatory plea, there was a judgment
against the plaintiff but not upon the merite. This operation was
gradually abrogated before the time of J ustinian, only leaving
traces of itself in the Novatio necessaria, which extinguished indeed
civilis obligatio but left a naturalis obligatio, sufficient to support
the pignora or hypothecae by which the plaintiff was protected.
Processual consumption had only considered the Intentio of the
action that was brought: the exceptio rei judicatae, by which in
later times the same or similar objects were accomplished, regarded
the exact import of the Sententia. The most signal departure from
the principle of processual consumption was perhaps J ustinian's
constitution, Cod. 8, 41, 28, concerning Correality and FidejussiO,
p. 398. As Correality is a-single obligation imposed on several
debtorS, a suit against one extinguished the obligation of ‘the
remainder: e.g. a suit brought against a principal extinguished
the right of suing the surety, and vice versa. Justinian enacted
that the obligation of the remaining correal debtors should not be
extinguished even by judgment against one, but only by perceptio,
soluti0, satisfactio, complete satisfaction of the plaintiff’s claim.

2. (a) Litis contestatio, in the classical period, by interrupting
Prescription‚ 4 ᾧ 110, saved the plaintiff’ s title from being barred
by lapse of time. At a later period, Prescription was interrupted
by a still earlier event, InsinuatiO. As soon as Prescription of the
right of action was interrupted, Prescription of pendency began to
run, 4 ξ 103.

Moreover, respecting the plaintiff' s Title or ground of action it
is a general rule that no causa supervenienti, or entitling event, sub-
sequent to Litis contestatio can avail to save the plaintiff from
losing the action already brought, though it may give him the
right to bring another. Further‚ as a general rule, the ground of
action must not only exist before Litis contestatio but must con-
tinue up to condemnatio, Otherwise in virtue of the maxim:
Omnia judicia esse absolutoria, 4& 114, the defendant will be ab·
solved. E.g. if the defendant in an action of theft was a conditional
