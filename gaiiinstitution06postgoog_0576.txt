waS, that the creditor who received his share was obliged to bind
himself to refund in case any new creditore should present their
claims‚ whereas in De peculio the law adopted the principle, melior
est condiffio occupantis.

The actio Quod jussu, unlike the foregoing, is founded on the
superior’s consent to a single contract of the inferior.

The actio De in rem verso is founded on the advantage derived
by the superior from a single contract of the inferior. The formula
for this action was the same as that for De peculio, with a second
additional condemnatio, whereby the creditor might recover from
the superior the amount of the superior’s gain in addition to the
amount of the poeulium.

One contract with a filiusfamilias, namely‚ the loan of money

(mutui datio) without the sanction of the father, was always invalid, ·

in pursuance of the Senatusconsultum Macedonianum passed in the
reign of Claudius or Vespasian.

Besides the equitable actions introduced by the praetor, a pater-
familias was rendered liable by the act of his son or slave to a
condictio, that is, was liable under the civil law to an action stricti
juris in two cases (which we must probably limit with Savigny
by the hypothesis of a Money loan) if the act turned to his profit
· (si in rem ejus versum est), and if it had received his sanction, for a
contract entered into by his order was regarded as his contract. The
liability of the superior follows from the statement of the gist of
CondictiO‚ page 502. Illud in summa admonendi sumus, id quod
jussu patris dominive contractum fuerit, quodque in rem ejus ver-
sum erit, directo quoque posse a patre dominove condici‚ tanquam
si principaliter cum ipso negotium gestum esset. Ei quoque qui vel
exercitoria vel institoria actione tenetur directo posse condici placet,
quia hujus quoque jussu contractum intelligitur, Inst. 4, ⁷, 8. If
the paterfamilias had neither ordered the transaction nor profited
by it, the creditor's only remedy against him were the actions
de peculio and tributor-ia.
