The Forum at which an action can be brought is twofold: it is
either General or Special. The General forum is the forum of the
domicil of the defendant: actor rei forum, sive in rem sive in per-
sonam sit acti0, sequitur, Cod. 3, 19, 3. Juris ordinem converti
postulas, ut non actor rei forum sed reus actoris sequatur, Cod. 3,
13, 2. See p. 337.

The Special forum depende on the nature of the right to be
litigated: on the department of the code to be applied.

The special forum of a Real right is the forum where the Res
(subject of property, servitude) is situated <forum rei Sitae).

The special forum of an Obligation is generally, in Roman law,
tbe forum of the place where the act is covenanted to be performed
(forum Solutionis). In English law it is rather the forum of the
place where the contractors entered into their contract, forum Con-
tractus. It was when a stipulation was enforced at· the general
forum of the defendant instead of at the special forum of the
stipulation that it was necessary to use the formula Arbitraria.

'I'he special forum of a Delict is the place where the delict was
committed. ‚ .

The special forum of Insolvency coincides in Roman law with the
general forum, i. e. is the domicil of the insolvent.

The Special forum of Succession (hereditatis petitio) is the forum
of the locus delicti (trespass of the defendant) which will coincide
with the place where the subject of inheritance is situated (forum
rei Sitae).

Distinet from the question of the Forum that has jurisdiction over
a right or obligation is the question of the Law that defines such
right or obligation: what local, municipal, or national Isaw governs
the relation of the plaintiff and defendant, and has to be adminis-
tered by the Forum, whatever and wherever it may be, that exer-
cises jurisdiction.

The question of the Forum before which a suit must be instituted
and of the particular Law which such Forum must administer may
arise (1) within the limite of a single state when divided‚ like the
Roman empire, into municipalities with separate jurisdictions and,
'to a certain extent, separate laws: or (2) in more or less intimate
aggregatione of provinceS, cantons, states, such as we see in Switzer-
land, Holland, Germany, America3 or (3) between different sove-
reign states,

The territorial, local, or municipal law that governs a particular
