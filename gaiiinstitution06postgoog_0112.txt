siet, uti patri endo filio est. Haec ita uti dixi, ita vos, Quirites,
rogo. 5, 19. ‘ Adrogation is the subjection of an independent
person with his own consent to the power of a superior, and is not
transacted in the dark or without investigation. 'Phe Comitia
Curiata, at which the College of Pontiffs is present, are convened,
and examine whether the age of the adrogator does not rather
qualify him for the natural procreation of children, and whether the
estate of the adrogatus is not the object of fraudulent cupidity, and

an oath, said to be framed by Q. Mucius, the high pontiff, has to be “

taken by the adrogator. . . . Adrogation, the name given to this
transit into a strange family, is derived from the interrogation of
the legislative body, which is in the following form: ‘ May it please
you to will and command that L. Valerius shall be as completely
by law and statute the son of L. Titius, as if he were born of L.
Titius and his wife, and that L. Titius shall have power of life and

vanished as soon as the lex Curiata, as form of adrogation‚ was
superseded by imperial rescript (principale rescriptum), Dig. 1, 7,
21. Women, being incapable of exercising parental power, could
not, properly speaking, adrogate 3 but they were permitted by quasi
adrogation to establish the same legal relation as existed between a
mother and her natural children, Cod. 8, 48, 5. An adrogator was
usually required to be sixty years old, Dig. 1, 7, 15, and to be
eighteen years (plena pubertate) older than adrogatuS, Inst. 1, 11, 4.
Originally a youth must have attained the age of puberty before he
could be adrogated, ᾗ 102: Sed adrogari non potest nisi jam
vesticeps . . . . quoniam tutoribus in pupillos tantam esse auctori-
tatem potestatemque fas non est, ut caput liberum fidei suae eom-
missum alienae ditioni subiciant, Gellius, ibid. ‘ A youth cannot be
adrogated before he has assumed the toga virilis, because a guardian
has no authority or power to subject an independent person, with
whose charge he is entrusted, to the domination of a stranger.' The
