of title be contributed by different persons? Can the Intention
of disposing‚ that is, of acquiring or aliening, reside in 0116, and
can its Execution, its external manifestation, be delegated to a
representative Ρ

Originally, that is, under the ancient civil law, representation
was only admitted when the representative was in an inferior status
to the principal, was his slave, or subject to his potestas, manuS, or
mancipium. This limitation was found to be inconvenient, when,
in the progress of Roman conquest, Roman citizens became pro-
prietors in remote parts of the world3 and Possession was allowed
to be acquirable by the instrumentality of libera persona, that is, of
a person who stood in no relation of inferiority to the acquirer. In
a civil solemnity, like mancipation‚ a man could not be represented
by an independent agent3 but when, subsequently, the transfer of
possession became 1116 universal mode of transferring dominion, it
followed that Property, as well as Possession, could 116 acquired by
the agency of libera persona. Si procurator rem mihi emerit ex
mandato meo, eique sit tradita 11160 1101111116, dominium mihi et pro-
prietas acquiritur etiam ignoranti, Dig. 41, 1, 13. ‘If an agent
bnys a thing by my instructionS‚ and receives possession thereof
in my name, the dominion and property is acquired for me even
without notice of his act.' Per liberam personam ignoranti quoque
adquiri possessionem et, postquam scicntia intervenerit, usucapionis
conditionem inchoari posse, tam ratione utilitatis quam jurispru-
dentia receptum est, Cod. 7, 32, 1. ‘An independent person may
bc an instrument whereby, without notice, a principal may acquire
possession, and, after notice, may commence usucapion ,- as is
established both by motives of convenience and principles of juris-
prudence.’ Notice was required for usucapion, because, as we have
seen, usucapion requires bona fides·

The acquisition of obligations or personal rights by brokeragc of
an independent agent was less perfectly developed. Originally, the
process employed was a duplication of the relation of agency (man-
datum). A as principa] (dominus) appointed B his agent (pro-
curator). B then contracted with a third party in his own name,
and, in order 10 transfer the benefit of his contract to A, he ceded to
him his right of action, that is to say, B, as principal, in his turn
made A his agent (procurator in rem suam), whereby A was able to
sue in the name of B, and obtain judgment in the name of A.
F inally, the praetor allowed the principa] to sue immediately, with·-
