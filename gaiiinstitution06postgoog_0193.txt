11. §§ 15-27.] RERUM O. ADQUISITIONES CIVILES. 171

Of civil Titles the oldest were probably in jure cessio and usu-
capi0, the one public the other private, the one containing an act
of a political authority, the other subordinate and supplementary
to this, and though equally effectual where it applied, yet not quite
so extensive in its application.

In jure cessio or surrender before a magistrate cannot fail to
recall to an English lawyer two similar modes of alienation that
recently existed in English jurisprudenee, alienation by Fine and
alienation by Recovery, both of which, like in jure cessio, were
based on a fictitious action3 in both of which, that is to say,
although the parties did not really stand in the relation of adverse
litigants, the alienee was supposed to recover an estate ΒΥ process of
law. By a Fine, an action commenced against the alienor and at
once terminated ΒΥ his acknowledging the right of the aheneo, a
tenant iu tail could aliene the fec simple, so far at least as to bar
his own issue. ΒΥ a Recovery, a tenant in tail could convey an
absolute estate in fee. This was an act-ion supposed to be, not like
a Fine immediately compromised, but carried on through every
regular stage to the conclusion; whereby the alienee recovered
judgment against the alienor, who in his turn recovered judgment
against an imaginary warrantor whom he vouched to warranty
(cf. laudat auctorem, 3 ξ 139, commentary). Another employment
of fictitious action in English law as a solemn form, not of aliena·
tion but of contract, a title, consequently, not of jus in rem but of
jus in personam, namely, the Judgment Debt (see 3 ἕ 134, com-
mentary), has no parallel in Roman jurisprudenee of the classical
period: though in earlier times the Nexum, expressing the obli-
gation of the promisor by the term Damnas, i. e. condemnatus,
apparently placed him in the position of a judgment debtor (pro
judicato), and rendered him liable to the most rigorous form of
execution (manus injectio).

In jure cessio to a late period was the principal mode of manu-
mitting slaves, and a part of the process of emancipation, that ia,
the release of a son from the patria potestas.

To relieve the magistrate and the parties from the troublesome
process of in jure cessio, a new mode of conveyance, ΒΥ bronze and
balance (nexum, mancipium, per aes et libram), which did not
require the intervention of a public functionary, was introduced at
some subsequent period, but confined to the alienation of certain
specific subjecte of property. 'Phe things capable of this mode of
