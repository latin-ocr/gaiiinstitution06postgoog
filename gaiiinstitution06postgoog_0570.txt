Titio pecuniam petat bonorum emp· of a debt of a different genus. Thus,

Condemnatio.

§GL Compensation was originally limited to claims growing
out'of the same ground (ex eadem causa, § 61); growing out of a
transaction, that is, that generated either a bilateral obligation
and gave to both parties an actio directa, or a semi-bilateral ob-
ligation, giving to one party actio directa and to the other actio
contraria. In other words Compensatio was confined to actions
ex bona fide. 'I'he emperor Marcus Aurelius made the identity of
title (eadem causa) unnecessary: he allowed Compensatio to be
urged against claims based on transactions that could only
generate unilateral obligations: in other wordS, he admitted Com-
pensatio in Condictiones or stricti juris actiones. (It was merely
by inadvertence that J ustinian in compiling his own Institutione
out of these of Gaius retained the words ex eadem causa in the
definition of Compensation, Inst. 4, 6, 39. Savigny ᾧ 45.)

In an actio bonae fidei Compensation of the defendant's counter-
claim ex eadem causa would not require to be commanded by an
express exeeptiO, but would be included in the officium judicis;
i. e. would be made by the judex in virtue of the terms Ex Bona
nnn contained in the formula which gave him his commission.
In an actio stricti 'juris the judex was empowered to make eom-
pensation by the Exceptio Doli mali: Sed et in strictis judiciis
ex rescripto divi Marci, opposita doli mali exceptione, compensatio
