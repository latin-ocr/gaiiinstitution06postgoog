against a heres charged with a legacy in the form of condemnation,
4 § 9 3 and from the terme, dare damnas esto=dare judicatus esto,
employed both in the lex Aquilia, p. 384, and in bequest by the
form of condemnation, 2 ᾧ 201, it may be inferred with much
probability that both the author of unlawful damage and the heir
charged with a legacy by words of condemnation were subject, in
the older period of the law, to the same proceedings as the judg-
ment debtor (judicatus); that is, in early times were suable by
Manus injectio, 4 ξ 25, and in later times were bound to give
satisdatio judicatum solvi, 4 ξ 102.

Double damages‚ as a penalty of misrepresentation, were also
an incident of Nexum. Cum ex 12 Tabulis satis esset ea praestari
quae essent lingua nuncupata, quae qui infitiatus esset dupli poe-
nam subiret, a jureconsultis etiam reticentiae poena est constituta,
Cic. De off. 3, 65. ‘ While the Twelve Tables were satisfied with
requiring compensation for faults against which a mancipator had
expressly warranted, and with punishing a false warranty by double
damages, the jurists imposed a similar penalty on reticence.'

constitutum was a pact (not a stipulation) promising to pay
a pre-existing debt on a certain day. If the pre-existing obli-
gation was a natural obligation of the promisor, the constitutum
converted a natural into a civil obligation; if it was the obligation
of another person, it operated as a guaranty.

As an extremely easy means of transforming naturalis obligatio
into civilis obligatio, that is, of arming a creditor with the sharp
remedies of the civil law, the invention of the Consensual contract
of Constitutum sufficiently explainS, as already suggested, the
desuetude of the Literal contract of Expensilatio, a process which
the ancient Romans employed for the same purpose.

In Condictio and Constitutum the sponsio was optional (permit- j ‹ 12
titur): in Interdicts it was compulsory, ξ 141. Bethmann-Holl- ' ‘⁶ ³

ξ 175. Α charge of calumny implies guilty knowledge or un-
lawful intention (dolus), the Contrary action implies unlawful
ignorance, that is, recklessness or want of consideration (culpa,
temeritas).

§ 176. In three personal actions each party was considered as
both plaintiff and defendant and had to take both the oath of the
plaintiff and the oath of the defendant. Qui familiae erciscundae
