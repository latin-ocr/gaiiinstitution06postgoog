dare litis et vindiciarum, id est rei
et fructuum: alios autem praedes
ipse Praetor ab utroque accipiebat
sacramenti, quod id iu publicum
cedebat. festuca autem utebantur
quasi hastae loco, signo quodum
iusti dominii: vmxime enim sua
esse credebant quae ex hostibus
cepissent3 unde in centumviralibus
iudiciis hasta praeponitur.

ᾗ 17. Si qua res talis erat, ut
non sine incommodo posset in ius
adferri vel adduci, velut si columna
aut grex alicuius pecoris osset, pars
aliqua inde sumebatur. deinde in
eam partem quasi in totam rem
praesentem fiebat vindicatio. itaque
ex greye vel una ovis aut capra in
ius adducebatur, vel etiam pilus
inde sumebatur et in ius adfereba-
tur 3 ex nave vero et columna aliqua
pars defi-ingebatur. similiter si de
fundo vel de aedibus sive de here-
ditate controversia erat, pars aliqua

inde sumebatur et in ius adfere-

batur et in eam partem perinde
atque in totam rem praesentem fie-
bat vindicatio : velut ex fundo gleba
sumebatur et ex aedibus tegula, ct
si de hereditate controversia erat,
aeque [folium deperditum]

SACRAMENTU M.

The praetor then awarded to one
of the claimants possession of the
thing pending the suit, and made
him bind himself with sureties to
his adversary to restore both the
subject of dispute and the mesne
profits or value of the interim
possession, in the event of losing the
cause. Both parties gave pledges
to the praetor for the penal sum
which the loser was to forfeit. The
wand or straw which they wielded
represented a lance, the symbol of
absolute dominion, for the best
title to property was held to be
conquest. Accordingly the law of
property is administered in the
Centumviral court at the present
day under the symbol of a lance.

ξ 17. If the subject of dispute
was such as could not conveniently
be carried or led before the praetor,
a portion was brought into court,
and the formalities were enacted
over it as if it was the whole. If
it was a flock of sheep or herd of
goats, a single sheep or goat, or a
single tuft of hair was brought ; if
it was a ship or column, a fragment
was broken off and brought; if it
was laud, a clod 3 if it was a house,
a tile 3 if it was an inheritance. . . .

ᾧ 13. The sacramentum or stake was originally deposited with

the Pontifex and applied, when forfeited, to meet the expensos of
the public sacrifices3 whence its name. Afterwards„ instead of an
actual deposit, security [praedeszpraewades] for the penal sum
was given by both parties to the praetor.

In the ceremony as described by Gaius we may distinguish
three stages: first, an oral pleading or altercation [secundum suam

causam sicut dixi-J us peregi sieut vindictam imposui]; secondly,
