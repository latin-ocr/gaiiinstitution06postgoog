year, nor against the successor of the defendant, as it is founded on
delict and penal, except so far as the successor is enriched by the
fraud of the wrong-doer; but is transmissible to the successor of
the plaintiff, as its object is reparation.' The last words seem to
mean: because it is not Vindictive: for, with the exception of
V indictive actions, even purely pcnal actions are actively trans-
missible, i. e. transmissiblc to the heir of the plaintiff, § 112.

In these 011505, accordingly, the plaintiff had not always an
adequate remedy under the Roman law. English law originally
followed the rule of Roman law, and no action of Tort, even for
damage to property, would lie against the executor or administrator
of 1110 wrong-doer. [The maxim: actio personalis moritur cum
persona, often used by expositors of English law, must have origi-
nated in a misprint of personalis for poenalis] But now, by 3 and
4 Will. IV, 0. 42, an action for injury to property, as opposed to
actions for slander and the like (vindictive actionS, which die with
the person), is maintainable against the executors and administra-
tors of the wrong-doer, provided the wrong was committed within
six months before his death and the action is brought within a year
after his (1011111, if it was an injury 10 real property, or within

certa, as well as poenae persecutio, An obligation to pay a certain
sum is called a Debt.

§8. In Justinian's timc the penalty of Rapine was only thrice
the value of 1110 thing taken with violence, that is, the quadruple
damages were partly penal, for the actions vi bonorum raptorum
and the real or personal action to recover the thing taken were not
concurrent or cumulative. For a case of quadruple damageS, of
