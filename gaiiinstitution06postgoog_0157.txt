pator could not become statutory guardian, it leaves unexplained

why be became fiduciary guardian.

DE PETENDO Amo TUTORE.

ξ 173. Praeterea senatusconsulto
mulieribus permissum est in ab·
sentis tutoris locum alium petere:
quo petito prior desinit. nec interest
quam longe aberit is tutor.

ξ 174. Set excipitur, ne in ab·
sentis patroni locum liceat libertae
tutorem petere.

ξ 175. Patroni autem loco habe-
mus etiam parentem qui in e mn-
cipio‘sibi remancipatam filiam nep-
temve aut proneptem manumissione
legitimam tutelam nanctus est.
f huius quidem liberi fiduciarii tu-

ῑ, toris loco numerantur: patroni
ἶ autem liberi eandem tutelam adi-

piscuntur, quam et pater eorum
halguffiss· Sed ad certam quidem
causam etiam in patroni absentis
locum permisit senatus tutorem pe-
{leat-ne, veluti ad hereditatem adeun-

ξ 177. Idem senatus censuit et
in persona pupilli patroni filii.

§178. Itemque lege Iulia de
maritandis ordinibus ei quae in
legitima tutela pupilli sit permitti-
tur dotis constituendae gratia a
praetore urbano tutorem petere.

ξ 179. Sane patroni filius etiamsi '

inpubes sit, libertae efficietur tutor,
at in nulla re auctor fieri potest,
cum ipsi nihil permissum sit sine
tutoris auctoritate agere.

ξ 173. Moreover‚ a decree of the
senate permits female wards to de-
mand a substitute in the place osan
absent guardian, and the appoint-
ment of a substitute supersedes the
previous guardian, and the length
of his absence is immaterial. ‚

ξ 174. But an exception is made
in favour of au absent patron, who
cannot be superseded on the appli-
cation of a freedwoman.

ξ 175. Ranked with patrous is
the parent who by mancipation, re-
mancipation, and manumission of a
daughter, granddaughter, or great-
granddaughter, has become her sta-
tutory guardian. His sons only
rank as fiduciary guar-diane, unlike
a patron's sons, who succeed to the
same form of guardianship as vested
in their father.

ξ 176. For a special and limited
purpose the senate permits even a
patron in bis absence to be super-
seded by a substitut03 for instance,
to authorize the acceptance of an
inheritance.

ξ 177 . The senatusconsult gives
similar permission when a patron’e
son is himself a ward.

ξ 178. Before the senatusconsult
the lex J ulia regulating the mar-
riages of the various orders, when
a patron's son who was statutory
guardian of a woman was himself a
ward, permitted the woman to apply
to the praetor of the city to substi-
tute a guardian for the purpose of
effecting a settlement of her dower.
ξ 179. For a patron's son even
before the age of puberty is a freed-
w<21l111an¹s guardian, baffi· unabsse · to
au onze any proc ing, emg
himself disabled from acting with-
out his guardian’s authorization.
