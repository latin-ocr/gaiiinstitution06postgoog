662 ADDENDUM.
transferred to a new creditor, it cannot in his hands be impeached
for any want of causa: the remedy of the debtor (expromissor), if
he has become aware of a want of consideration for his promise, is
not against the transferree but against the original creditor (dele-
gator). Sed si per ignorantiam promiserit creditori, nulla quidem
exceptione adversus creditorem uti poterit, quia ille suum recepit,
sed is qui delegavit tenetur condictione, Dig. 46, 2, 12. Doli ex-
cepti0, quae poterat deleganti opponi , cessat in persona creditoris
cui quis delegatus est, Dig. 46, 2, 193 Dig. 23, 3, 78, 5. This
stability of the effecte of Formal contract was obviously of the
utmost importance to the development of infant commerce.

The validity of Formal contracte irrespective of the causal factor
was to a certain extent infringed in later jurisprudence ΒΥ the ad-
mission of the Exceptio non numeratae pecuniae. For the space of
two years after a stipulatio the creditor who-sought to enforce the
contraet was under the necessity of proving the existence of the
causa (numeratio pecuniae): to this extent, then, Stipulatio was
reduced to the disadvantageous position of a Formless contr-act.

Fomssn, dispositione were not confined to the sphere of contract:
in the sphere of alienations Traditio is Formless while Mancipatio
and In jure cessio are Formal. Formal alienatione present the same
contrast that we noticed between Formal conventions. Mancipatio
by its simulation of a purchase and the payment of purchase money
makes the same shadowy recognition of a causal factor that Nexum
and Expensilatio made by the fiction of a loan: while in J ure οεεείο
(if we can speak with confidence of a process about which we know
so little) resembled Stipulatio in containing no such recognition.

Ihering who has handled this topic, § 55, applies the term
Assmo'r to Formal alienations. When, however, we compare
Formal and Formless alienations we find the terms Abstract and
Conci-ete not so applicable to alienations as they were to conven-
. tions, and for this reason: in Formless alienation there is as com-
plete an ABSTRACTION or severance of the sequent· from the causal
factor as there is in Forma13 and Tradition is as unilateral a tran-
saction as Mancipation or J udicial Surrender.

This assertion may seem inconsistent with the doctrine (p. 201)
that, to constitute a valid alienation, Tradition must be preceded by
some justa causa, Donatio, Contractio, or Solutio. This preceding
disposition, however, is not required in order to form the causal
factor of a bilateral disposition, but in order to furnish evidence of
