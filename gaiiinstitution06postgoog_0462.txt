§ 180. Tollitur adhuc obligatio
litis contestatione, si modo legitimo
iudicio fuerit actum. nam tunc obli-
gatio quidem principalis dissolvitur,
incipit autem teneri reus litis con-
testatione ε sed si condemnatus sit,
sublata litis contestatione incipit ex
causa iudicati teneri. et hoc est
quod aput veteres scriptum est,
ante litem contestatum dare debito·
rem oportere, post litem contestatam
condemnari oportere, post con·

demnationem iudicatum facere opor-

iudicio debitum petiero, postea de
eo ipso iure agere non possim, quia
inutiliter intendo DARI mm opon-

DE OBLIGATIONIBUS.

claim is extinguished3 and, con-
sistently herewith, he held that, if
the debt of Lucius Titius is stipu-
lated by the creditor from a slave,
novation takes place, and while the
original obligation is extmguished,
the second is void because the slave
cannot be sued. But m both cases
the contrary rule prevaiIS, and no
novation occurs in these ceses any
more than it occurs if an alien, who
cannot be sponsor, promise pay-
ment of a debt by the solemn term,
‘ spondeo!

ξ 180. The extinction of an obli·
gation is also effected by the com-
mencement of an action, at least of
a statutory action [that is to say, an
action substituted by statute for
any form of statute-process} Then
the original obligation is dissolveti,
and a new obligation is imposed on
the defendant, by the commence-
ment of the action. If he is con·
demned, the second obligation is
discharged, and a third obligation
is imposed by the judgment. Hence
the saying of the old writerS, that,
before action brought, a defendant
is required by the law to convey;
after action brought, he is required
to be condemned3 after condemna-
tion passed, he is required to satisfy
the judgment.

ξ 181. Accordingly, after suing
by statutory action, the extinction
of the original obligation disables
me from bringing a second aetion,
for the declaration that the de·
fendant is bound to convey is false,
as the commencement of the first
action terminated his obligation to
convey. It is otherwise if 1 sued
at first by an action ‹letermining
with (or, deriving its force from)
the praetorship. T hen the original
obligation continues, and its non-
extinction permits me to bring a
second action5 but I may be re-
pelled by the counteracting plea of
