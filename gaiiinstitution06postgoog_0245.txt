to Commercium, and therefore is ascribed to all cives, all Latini,
and all aliens who have received a grant of commercium.

Το make a will, however, a testator must have not only personal
capacity, but he must also have property to leave. This latter
condition is necessarily wanting to the Filiusfamilias and to the
Latinus Junianus: in their case, therefore, Testamentifactio does not
mean capacity of being testator, but of playing some other part in
the mancipatory will; i. e. of being devisee‚ or legates, or witness.

The testator's capacity is required at two periods: at the time of
making the will and at the time of the testator’s death. The strict
civil law also required the continuance of capacity during the in-
terval between these dates: but the praetor disregarded any inter-
vening incapacity (capitis diminutio), and, notwithstanding such an
event, gave the will efficacy by granting to the devisee‚ not the
civil hereditas which was beyond his power but, juxta-tabular pos-
session (bonorum possessio juxta or secundum tabulas) 2 § 147,
Ulpian 23, 6. Exigit praetor ut is eujus bonorum possessio datur
utroque tempore jus testamenti faciendi habuerit, et quum facit
testamentum et quum moritur . . . . Sed si quis utroque tem-
pore testamentifactionem habuerit, medio tempore non habuerit,
bonorum possessio secundum tabulas peti poterit, D. 37, 11, 1. 8.

Two other cases of incapacitation were cured by the principle of
postliminy and the lex Cornelia testamentaria: if a testator suffered
capitis diminutio maxima by falling into the hands of the enemy,
if he returned from captivity his will reacquired validity by the
operation of postliminy: if he never returned his will obtained va-
lidity by the fiction that he died a moment before his capture. Qua-
tenus tamen diximus ab hostibus capti testamentum irritum fieri,
adjiciendum est postliminio reversi vires suas recipere jure postliminii,
aut si ibi decedat lege Cornelia confirmari, D. 28, 3, 6, 12. In om-
nibus partibus juris is qui reversus non est ab hostibus, quasi tunc
decessisse videtur cum captus est, D. 49, 15, 18. Ulpian, 23, 5.

· The physica] conditions of testamentary incapacity (infancy,
lunacy) are only critical at the date of making the will.

The praeterition of suus heres, another circumstance which as
well as testamentifactio affected the validity of a will, was at civil
law critical both at the time of making the will and at the time of
the testator's death and in the interval: but in later times this
defect of a will was healed by the praetor who granted juxta-tabular
possession if the defect only existed at the first and third period,
