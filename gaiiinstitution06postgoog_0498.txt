476 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [111. ξς 220-225. ΐ
1

Bethmann-Hollweg supposes that the praetorian 80110 injuriarum
contained a fictio, 4 ᾧ 32, 8811 suggests the following formula:

Demonstratio .· Quod Aulo Agerio a Numerio Negidio pugno
mala percussa est,

Retio .· Si ob eam rem Numerium Negidium ex lege ab Aulo
Agerio talionem pati oporteret,

Condemnatio .- Quantum tibi, judex, aequum esse videbitur, tantae
pecuniae dumtaxat sestertios tot Numerium N egidium Aulo Agerio
condemna: Si non paret, absolve.

In the Roman law in force at the present day, as the basis or
Common Law of German jurisprudence, bilaterally penal suits
appear to be obsoleto, with the exception of actio Injuriarum 3 and
here the modern plaintiff has his election between pecuniary dam·
ages and an apology or revocation of the injurious utterance. An
inquiry into the reason why the actio injuriarum alone has survived
will illustrate the nature of bilaterally penal suits. Their 111-1801Ρώ
object, as already suggested, was to induce the aggrieved party to
abstain from the remedy offered him in archaic society, sels-tedress
or private revenge. In the 0800 of other wrongs such inducement
is no longer necessary. But in the case of Affront or Dishonour the
effect of the modern code of honour has led the moderns even more
than the ancients to prefer the 81011810 institution of Feud or private
war, as embodied in the Duel, to an unromantic appeal to the public
tribunals. Here, then, the inducement to abstain from sslf-help,
which elsewhere is not needed, is still required.

Thett and Rapine are removed in the present day from the Penal
branch of the Private code 10 1110 (1111111881 001105 11181 10, 810 not
punished at 1110 discretion of 8 private plaintiff, but by the 801108 of
a public prosecutor. Savigny, Law of Obligation, ξ 84.

Gaius seems to have been misled by a double meaning of Injuria
when he connects the actio Injuriarum with the 10111000 given by the
Twelve Tables for grievous bodily harm, ξ 223. There seems to 110
80 1081 connexion between bodily 1181111 and dishonour, although
both may have been denoted in Latin by the word Injuria.

After treating of obligations created by delict, J ustinian proceeds
to a fourth class, namely, obligations quasi ex 1101101ος Four in-
stances of these are given 2—(1) Si judex litem suam fecerit, i. e. if 8
judge makes a liability his own (or, makes a suit against himselt),
that is, makes himself actionable by giving a judgment contrary to
law, whether from corruption or from ignorance, he was liable 10
