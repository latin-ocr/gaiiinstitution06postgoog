cedat, ea accidunt quae proxime
diximus de eo ad quem ab intestato
legitimo iure pertinet hereditas, si
post obligationem in iure cedat.

ξ 37. Idem et de necessariis here-
dibus diversae scholae auctores ex-
istimant, quod nihil videtur inter-
esse utrum aliquis adeundo here-
ditatem fiat heres, an invitus existat:
quod quale sit, suo loco apparebit.
sed nostri praeceptores putant nihil
agere necessarium heredem, cum in
iure cedat hereditatem.

of an intestata succession after ac·
ceptance.

§37. So has a surrender by a
necessary successor according to the
other school, because it seems im-
material whether a man is a volun-
tary or an involuntary successor (a
distinction that will be explained
hereafter): according to my school
a necessary heir’s surrender of the
inheritance is inoperative. [3 ξ 85.]

ξ 38. obligations, in whatever
way contr-acted, are incapable of
transmission by either method. If
I wish to transfer my claim against
a third person, none of the modes
whereby corporea] things are trans·
serred is effective: but Ι must order
the alienee to bind the debtor by
stipulation: whereupon my debtor
is discharged of his debt to me and
becomes liable to the alienee; which ,
transformation of a debt is called
novation.

ξ 39. In default of such novation
he cannot sue in his own name, but
must sue in my name as my cognitor
or procurator.

ᾧ 28. 80 incorporeal hereditaments in English law were said
to lie in grant, not in feoffment‚ i.e. to be only conveyable by

deed, or scaled writing3 whereas corporeal hereditaments were .

conveyable by fcoffment, i. e. by livery of seisin or delivery of

possession.

§30. Inalienability was no peculiar characteristic of Usufruct
and other personal servitudes. Alienation of rights, or singular
succession as opposed to inheritance or universal succession, was
the exception not the rule. Dominion over res singulae was

alienable but almost all other rights were intransferable.

Ifwe

except the delatio of hereditas legitima, ξ 35, hereditas, as we shall
see, was inalienable: and what is said of Rural servitudes, ᾧ 30,
refers to their creation, not to their alienation. In the law of
Persons Patria potestas, 1 ᾧ 134, and Tutela, 1 ᾧ 168, could be
transferred but only by judicial surrender (in jure cessio), i. e. a
