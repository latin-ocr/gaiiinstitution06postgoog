OORRIGENDA. 671

In the text of the Digest: delegare est vice sua alium reum
dare creditori vel cui jusserit, Dig. 46, 2, 11, pr„ the translation,
p. 430, assumes that cui jusserit means cui jusserit creditor reum
dari: but from the foregoing it appears to mean cui jusserit dele-
gans promitti: so that the whole passage should be translated:
‘ Delegation is to give another person instead of one’ s self as debtor
either to a creditor or to a. non-creditor.’

(2) a. In the same way Delegatus may either be indebted to
Delegator and have solvendi animus, as is assumed in
some of the texts above quoted ι

b. or he may have credendi animus, Cod. 8, 42, 5 z

c. or he may have donandi animus: Ut mihi donare& credi-
tori me0, delegante me, promisisti, Dig. 39, 5, 21.

If both Delegans was indebted to the Delegatee and Delegatus
to Delegans, there are two novations: if only one was indebted
there is one novation, if neither was indebted, the Delegation in-
volves no novation.

In Assignatio Assignans orders Assignatus not, as in Delegatio‚
to promise but, to pay a sum to the Assignatee. 'I'he relations
between the parties to an Assignatio are as various as those we
have indicated between the parties to a DelegatiO. Until payment‚
Assignans has a power of revoking the order, and Assignatus may
disobey the order: hence the maxim: Assignation is not payment.
But when payment is once made it produces novation and other
effects similar to those that are produced by DelegatiO. Baton,
Pandekten‚ ᾧ 307.

Possibly Dig. 46, 2, 11, pr„ in accordance with the original
version, contemplates a double delegation: i. e. a proceeding in
which the ultimate promisee is not the person whom we have
called Delegatarius or Delegatee but a fourth person, Delegatarius
,of Delegatarius primus, to whom Delegatarius primus may have
the intention solvendi or credendi or donandis

If Delegatarius primus is indebted to this fourth person, this
debt will be novated ε so that if Delegatus was indebted to Delegator
and Delegator to Delegatarius primus, there are three novatione.

Similarly Assignatio may be double: the ultimate payee may be
a fourth person, Assignatarius of Assignatarius primuS, a. creditor,
horrower, or donee of the first Assignatarius3 if heis not, as in the
