(2) A plaintiff had no remedy unless he could show that his case
had been contemplated by the legislator: but the legislator had
been too much occupied with foreign war and domestic dissension
to think of developing the private code. J urisprudence had been
busy in framing such actions as the system admitted3 but jurispru-
dence had little voice and little scope. If the law was silent, if
there was any hiatus or casus omissus, jurisprudence was not
allowed to fill up the void. The praetor himself had his hands tied
and was 6 16616 111666 of machinery. The institution of the For-
mulary process gave an 01366 10 1116 voice of jurisprudence‚ and the
power of issuing 6111616 6611 inventing new forms of action consti-

process by the legislator. The term, then, expresses elasticity. Α

We may observe by anticipation that the formulary system,
after an existence of nearly five hundred years, was brought 111 ’
1116 1636611111 of lawyers into the same discredit and experienced
the same fate as the system it had displaced. First Diocletian,
Aa). 294, made all judicia extraordinaria, that is, required the
magistrates to hear and determine all causes themselves, instead
of commissioning others to hear and determine them. Placet
