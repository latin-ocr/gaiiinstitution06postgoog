604 DE ACTIONIBUS. [1v.§§115-13⁷.

we have seen, may be derived not from aequitas but from jus
civile.

Ipsum jus as contrasted with exceptio denotes the totality of
the conditions comprehended in the intentio—the totality of the
elements, positive and negative, that constitute the plaintiff’s right:
in which definition positive elements are the conditione which call
a right into existence; negative elements are the absence of any
circumstance which could extinguish an existent right or dismiss it
into non-existence. Exceptio on the contrary denotes something
externa] to the sphere of the conditione of existence of the plaintiff’s
right; denotes the existence of an independent adverse right of
the defendant. Actio ipso jure nulla will denote a right null and
void by the conditione contemplated in the intentio and commonly
expressed by the word oportere: actio exceptionis ope infirmata a
right defeated by conditione external to the intentio. 'Phe words:
ipso jure, then, might be paraphrased by the words: si intentionem
tantum spectes3 or treated as equivalent to: ipsius jure or actoris jure.

The first mode of defence mentioned above denies the existence
of one of the positive constituent elements of the plaintiff’s right.

The second mode denies the existence of one of the negative
constituent elements of the plaintiff's right.

'I'he third mode alleges a second right, vested in a different
person, and generated by a title external to the sphere of the
conditione which constitute the right of the plaintiff.

In some cases the partition which separates avoidance from
counteraction will be extremely thin, and will consist in some
arbitrary appointment of positive law. E. g. litis contestatio in
judicium legitimum produced avoidance‚ while litis contestatio in
judicium imperio continens only produced counteraction‚ 3 ᾧ 181.

Some extinctions (ipso jure) of a plaintiff’s right, where we might
have expected only counterpoises (ope exceptionis) or counter rights
of a defendant, are to be explained by the fact that there was a
period when Roman procedure did not recognize Exceptions—
defences by positive averment of counterpoising rights—(nec
omnino ita ut nunc usus erat illis temporibus exceptionum, 4 ξ
108); but required every defence to be in the form of a simple
manoN—allegation of the original or subsequent NULLITY of
the plaintiff’s claim. At such a period one of the devices for
giving to the defendant the means of defence which he afterwards
had in the form of Exceptio was the introduction into the Sub-
