verbis. Dig. 9, 5, 15, ibid. 22, ibid. 25. The insertion of the state-
ment of Paulus, that conventions of the class, facio ut des, were not
enforcible by this action but only by the action de dolo, Dig. 19,
5, 5, 3, can only be regarded as an oversight of J ustinian, pro-
ducing an antinomy or self-contradiction of the law.

'Phe binding virtue of execution or delivery (traditio) was one
of the oldest principles of Roman law. In traditionibus rerum,
quodcunque pactum sit, id yalere‚ manifestissimum est, Dig. 2, 14, 48
(from the commentar-y of Gaius on the Twelve Tables) : and this
principle was, perhaps, the basis of the ordinance, Cum nexum
faciet mancipiumque, uti lingua nuncupassit, ita jus esto: which
afterwards remained in force when the traditio in a disposition by
Nexum was merely symbolic.

The actio in factum praescriptis verbis was so denominated because,
in the absence of a generic name for the contract, the fact begetting
the obligation was detailed at length in the demonstratio of the
formula: Actio quae praescriptis verbis rem gestam demonstrat,
Cod. 2, 4, 6. Hence it is often called actio in factum praescriptis
verbis. This, however, is a misleading name, because it might
lead us to suppose that the formula had an intentio in factum.
But it is a civil action, and the formula contains the word ‘ oportet’
(quidquid ob eam rem illum illi dare facere oportet), that is to say,
has an intentio in jus. 'Phe name of this Roman action ex con-
tractu may be illustrated by a comparison with the name of an
English action ex delicto, trespass on the case, so named from the
comparative partiquarity with which the circumstances of the
plaintiff’s case are detailed in the written allegations. It is some-
times called actio civilis incerti because it is brought to recover
damaqes (quanti interest).

Examples of Innominate contract are Exchange (permutatio),
Dig. 19, 43 Compromise (transactio), Dig. 2, 153 Cod. 2, 4 3 Con-
ditional sale (aestimatum), that is to say, a promise to pay a certain
price for an article if the promisor succeeds in reselling it at a
profit, with a power, in the opposite event, of returning the article
to the promisee, Dig.19, 3 3 and Permissive occupancy (precarium),
or permissiom at the request (precibus) of the grantee, to use an
article without compensation‚ with a proviso for redelivery on
demand. The precarious grantee (precario rogans), as a rule, has
Possession, but by special agreement may have mere Detention3
whereas the borrower for use (commodatarius) in every case has
