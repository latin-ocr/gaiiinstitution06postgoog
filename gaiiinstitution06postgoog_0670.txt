648 DE Aomomssus. [w. ξς 138-170.

If all the materials belonged to the proprietor of the whole, then
he who acquires by usucapion the whole is proprietor of all the
materials if they are subsequently separated, just as he would be
if he had acquired property in the whole by tradition or any other
valid form of alienation from the original proprietor.

If the dissolution of the whole precedes the completion of
usucapion, then the usucapion of the separate materials has to
begin ab initio, Dig. 41, 3, 23 pr. Thus, if a man has possessed
a house for nine years and six 1110111113, he will complete its usu·
capion in another six months: but if any of the materials (windows,
110013, 00111111113, 11103) 310 separated, he will require three years to
acquire them by usucapion as movableS.

If, on the contrary, a person begins by possessing 1110 11131011313
separately and after a time combines them 11110 3 whole, 1110 ques·
tion whether his usucapion of the materials continues to run de-
pends on the principles which govern the loss of possession.
Possession is not lost by the absence of animus possidendi, but
by a positive animus non possidendi. As this cannot here be
alleged to exist, the usucapion of the materials will continue to run
in spite of their combination and will be completed as soon as if
they had remained separate, Dig. 41, 3, 30, 1. An exception is
produced by the prohibition of the Twelve Tables to sue for building
materials as long as they form a portion of a house (tigna juncta
aedibuS, Dig. 47, 3) z for, as agere non valenti non currit praescriptiO,
the usucapion of the timber must be suspended until the house from
any cause is demolished. Vangerow, ᾧ 204.

Having passed in review the nature of Possession and the form
of the Possessory interdicts, we may now examine the often mooted
question what is the relation of Possession to the classification of
Rights as Real or Personal: to which division of actions, Real or
Personal, 13 procedure by the Possessory interdicte to be assimilated ‘1'

The answer to this must begin by distinguishing mere Pomon
or Interdict-possession, from Possession associated with Titulus and
Bona fides, or Usucapion-possession. The latter is incipient pro-
perty, and is recoverable by actio in rem Publiciana, 2 ξ 413 that
is, 13 treated in respect of its remedy 33 if it were perfect property:
Usucapion-possession then is a Real right and is recoverable by
3 Real action.

All interdict procedure belongs to the class of Personal actions
enforcing obligations generated by delict. J ure honorario obligamur
