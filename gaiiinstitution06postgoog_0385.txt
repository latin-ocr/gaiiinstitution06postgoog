ω. §5 ss, sa] NEXUM. 363

a single acceptor: a Bilateral convention is one where there are
two promissore and two acceptors, that is, where both parties are
equally promissore and acceptors.

The classification of contracte by Gaius does not include the
Nexum. Nexum apparently had three functione: it was a solemn

form of alienation (including testamentary disposition), a solemn ν

form of obligation, and a solemn form of extinction of obligation.
Si quid eo nomine debeatur quod per aes et libram gestum est,
3 ᾖ 173. Nexum, Mucius Scaevola scribit, quae per aes et libram
fiant ut obligentur praeterquam quae mancipio dentur, Varro, 6, 5.

‘ Nexum, according to Scaevola, is any disposition which employa the f. j
a bronze ingot and balance, either to produce an obligation or to aliene ³⁴ ’ ”“’

dominion.’ Nexum est, ut ait Gallus Aelius, quodcunque per aes

 

et libram geritur, idque necti dicitur 3 quo in genere sunt haec, ,
testamenti factin, nexi datio, nexi liberati0, Festus, under the word j
‘Nexum.’ ‘Nexum, according to Aelius, is any disposition by ι ·

means of the bronze ingot and balance, including testamentary ”¹¹⁴ ‘³'

disposition, formation of contract, discharge of contract.'

As a form of obligation or Contract Nexum was apparently a
fiction of a money loan (mutuum, certa pecunia credita): i. e. what·
ever the origin of the obligation, empti0, locatio, or agreement to
pay interest, Sto„ the debtor was transfor-med by nexum into a
borrower: he was suable by condicti03 and if he was condemned
and made default in satisfying the judgment he was liable to manus
injectio; i. e. to be taken into court in order that the praetor might
awai-d personal execution3 in other words deliver him as a quasi-
slave to the creditor (addicere, duci jubere).

In this function, i. e. as a form of solemn contract based on the
fiction of a loan, Nexum was abolished by the lex Poetelia, Livy,
8, 28: in its other functions, as a form of alienation (mancipatio),
and a form of extinction of obligation (acceptilatio), Nexum con-
tinued to exist in the time of Gaius, 3 Q 173. Savigny‚ Vermischte
Schriften, 19.

'Phe subsequent modes of Formal contract, Literal and Verbal,
seem like Nexum to have rested on a fiction of a loan of money.
We are expressly told this of Expensilation or Literal eontract,
ᾗ 129; and the etymology of Stipulatio (stips=pecunia) seems to
show that verbal contract also was originally based on the sup-

position that money had passed between the creditor and debtor.
But though Expensilatio and Stipulatio resembled Nexum in being
