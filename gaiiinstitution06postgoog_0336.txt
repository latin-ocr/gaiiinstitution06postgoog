to a different order of claimants‚ namely, to cognateS‚ or next of
kin, Ulpian‚ 26, 5. This rule was a scrupulous interpretation of the
exact words of the Twelve Tables: Si intestato moritur cui suus
heres nec escit, adgnatus proximus familiam habeto. No innovation
in this respect was introduced by the praetem, whose policy was to
prefer the natural title of cognation to the civil title of agnation.
J ustinian‚ however, abolished the rule‚ and allowed a devolution
through the degrees of ‘agnation‚ on the ground that, as the burden
of tutela devolved through the degrees of agnation‚ there ought to
be a corresponding and compensating devolution of the advantages
of inheritance, Inst. 3, 2, 7. This change, however, was deprived
of importance by the subsequent Novella, 118, which introduced an
entirely new system of successim, governed solely by cognatim

ᾧ 13. The moment at which it is ascertained that the deceased is
intestate will be separated by an interval from the moment of his
decease‚ when the intestacy is caused by the repudiation or in-
capacitation of the devisee‚ or the failure of the condition on which
he was instituted. In this interval the nearest agnate may die,
and a remoter agnate become the nearest agnato. It therefore was
necessary to determine whether the title of nearest agnate is ac·-
quired at the moment of decease or of ascertained intestacy3 and
the latter moment was selected. If the death of the testator had
been selected, then, if the nearaet agnate died in the interval, there
would be no heir: not the then next agnate, as proxumae, the
word used in the Twelve TableS, excludes successio graduum: nor
the gentiles, as the words: si agnatus nec escit, exclude successio
ordinum.

ᾧ 14. The limitation‚ in respect of females, of title by agnation
to females who were agnates in the first degree (consanguineae) was
not contained in the Twelve TableS, but introduced by the jurists as
an interpretation of the lex Voconia (B.c. 168), Paulus, Sent. Rec.
4, 8, 22. The harshness of this limitation was mitigated by the
praetors, who introduced title by cognation, and allowed females of
remoter degrees of agnation to succeed in the order of cognates in
default of successors by title of agnation 3 but J ustinian totally
abolished the limitation‚ and restored the rule of the Twelve Tables,
allowing females to succeed in the order of agnateS, however remote
might be their degree of agnation‚ provided that no nearer degree
was in existence.

The celebrated Novella, 118, as above stated, totally abolished
