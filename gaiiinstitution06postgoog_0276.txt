all the legacies should abate proportionably so as to leave the heir
a clear fourth of the portionjn *which he-*w-a-s* 1135&th (quarta
Falcidiae).

(4) 'Phe senatus consultum ngzgsgffinum provided against the
inheritance being similarly exhausted by fideicommissa.

We may add that an infant adopted by adrogation‚ if disin-
herited or without cause emancipated, was entitled to one fourth
