DE STATU LIBERORUM.

illegitimate or non-civil conception
the status of the offspring depends
on the moment of birth, and the
mother’s freedom at the moment of
birth makes the offspring free, and
the status of the father is immaterial:
but in legitimatc or civil conception
the status of the child is determincd
by the time of conception.

ξ 90. Accordingly, if a female
citizen of Rome being pregnant is
interdicted from fire and water, and
becoming thus an alien gives birth
to a child, many jurists distinguish
and hold that her offspring is a
Roman citizen if begotten in civil
wedlock, but if in promiscuous inter-
course, an alien.

ξ 91. So if a female citizen of
Rome being pregnant is reduced to
slavery under the Sc. Claudianum
for having intercourse with a slave
against the prohibition of his owner,
many jurists make a distinction and
hold that her offspring, if conceived
in civil wedlock is a citizen of Rome,
if conceived in illicit intercourse is
a slave of the person who becomes
proprietor of the mother.

ξ 92. Also if an alien woman
conceive in illicit intercourse and
afterwards becomes a Roman citizen
and gives birth to a child, the child
is a Roman citizen ; but if she con·
ceived by an alien, to whom she was
married in accordance with alien
laws and customs, it seems that
under Hadrian's senatusconsult her
offspring is born an alien, unless the
father also has acquired the Roman

franchise.

Supposing the status of a parent changes during the period of
goetation (if, for instance, the mother is a slave at the time of
conception and free at the time of birth), what effect has this on

the status of the issue? 'I'he following rule was adopted: in cases χ

where the child follows the status of the father, that is„ when it is

bcgofien in civil marriage, the status of the father at the time of

conception determines the status of the child3 where the child
