and inequality to the fundamental conception of law. If we ventured
on a Platonic myth, we might say that ZeuS, wishing to confer the
greatest possible gift on the human tace, took the most opposite
and uncombinable things in the universe, Equality and Inequality,
and, welding them together indissolubly, called the product by the
name of political society or positive law.

The assumption will hardly be controverted, that in the relations
of subject to subject, Positive law, like Ethical law, recognizes, as
an ideal at least, the identity of the just (lawful) with the equal.
Inequality‚ however, is no less essentially involved in positive law.
We have seen that there is no right and no duty by positive law
without a legislator and sovereign to whom the person owing the
duty is in subjection. On the one side weakness, on the other
irresistible power. Positive rights and duties‚ then, imply both
the relation of subject to subJect, and the relation of subject to
sovereign or wielder of the sanction, in other words, both the relation
of equal to equal, and the relation of unequal to unequal. It is
the more surprising that Austin should apparently have failed to
seize with precision this conception of the law of Persons‚ as be
makes the remark,· in which the whole truth seems implicitly con-
tained, that the bulk of the law of Persons composes the Public,
Political, or Constitutional code (jus publicum). Political society
or government essentially implies subordination. It implieS, on
the one hand, sovereign power reposing in various legislative
bodies, distributed, delegated‚ and vested in various corporations‚
magistrates, judges, and other functionaries ς on the other hand,
private persons or subjects subordinate to the sovereign power and
to its delegates and ministers. The different forms of government
are so many forms of subordination, so many relations of superior
and inferior, that is, so, many relations of uncquals. Public law,
then, is a law of Status, and the law of Persons or law of Status in
the private code is the intrusion of a portion of the public code
into the private code3 or, in barbarous and semi-civilized legisla-
tions, the disfigurement of private law by the introduction of
relations that properly belong to public law. For instance, the
most salient institution of the ancient Roman law of Person3‚ the
power of life and death over wife and child that vested in the father
of the household‚ was the concession to a subject of an attribute
that properly belongs to the sovereign or a public functionary.
Another institution, slavery, placed one subject over another in
