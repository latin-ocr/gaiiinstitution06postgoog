011 246-259] DE FiDEIcoMM. HEREDITATIBUS. 289

ᾗ 251. The transferree, it will be seen, was quasi heir when the
Sc. Trebellianum applied: when the Sc. Pegasianum applied he

was either quasi legatee or quasi vendee.
ᾗ 253. The terms of the Sc. Trebellianum, passed in the reign of

ἑ Nero, ΔΛ). 62, 010 given iu the Digest: Quum esset aequissimum

in omnibus fideicommissariis hereditatibus, si qua de ..his bonis
judicia penderent, ex his eos subire, in quos jus fructusque trans-
ferretur, potius quam cuique periculosam esse fidem suam3 placuit
et actiones, quae in heredes heredibusque dari solent, eas 11011110 111
000 11011110 1110 11011, qui fidei suae commissum, sicuti rogati essent,
restituissent, sed his et in eos quibus ex testamento fideicom-

missum restitutum fuisset, quo magis in reliquum confirmentur
supremae defunctorum voluntates, Dig. 31, 1, 2. ‘Forasmuch as
equity requires that whenever a succession is devised in trust, any
actions arising thereout should be brought against the transferree
of the 011000001011 01111 its benefits, 01111 that the devisee should incur
110 risk in consequence of his trust3 it is decreed that the actions of
01111 against an heir, shall not be granted to or against 011 11011 who
transfers a succession in pursuance of a trust, but to and against
the testamentary transferree, in order that iu future the last wishes
of testators may have more effect?

ᾦ 254. By the Sc. Trebellianum, if the whole beneficial interest
in an inheritance was transferred, the whole right of suing and
being sued passed to the transferree: if only a portion of the bene-
1101οΙ interest was transferred, both the transferror and the trans-
ferree could sue and be sued in the same proportion. The Sc.
Pegasianum, passed 111 the reign of Vespasian, A. D. ⁷o-7‘ 6 appa-
rently provided that when less than a fourth of the inheritance is
left to the benefit of the heir, the Sc. Trebellianum should be
inoperative, that is to say, that in 011011 0 0000 the actions by or
against the inheritance shall not be maintainable by or against
both the heir and transferree in the proportion of their interests, but
should be exclusively maintainable by or against the heir. In fact,
having subjected the transferree to the liability of abatement which
the lex Falcidia imposed on the legatee, it seemed logical to put him
in all other respects on the footing of a legatee, including the immu-

nity from being sued and incapacity of suing for the debts of the

succession. Having thus made the heir sole administrator, in order

to secure a just and ratable division of the gain and losses of ad-

ministration, the Sc. Pegasianum directed the heir and transferree
