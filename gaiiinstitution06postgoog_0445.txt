structed, or an article to be manufactured, the person who pays the
price, that is to say, the employer or orderer, is called locator3 the
person who performs the work or construction and receives the
price is called conductor. It may be worth inquiring how this

ι anomaly arose, and what led to this inversion of the menningo of

these correlative terms, and we shall find it in a certain incident
common to these and other conventions, and which has induced the
English law to regard them as composing a single class and to
denote them by a common denomination.

DGAEQSste loan for use, pawn or, pledge, letting and hiring, and
mandate, are gronped together in English law under the head of
-Bailments. Bailment, derived from the French word bailler, ‘ to
delisseiss’ffs defined to be a delivery of a chattel (movable) in trust
for a specific purpose3 or, at greater length, a delivery of goods on
a condition that they shall be restored by the bailee to the bailor,
or according to his direction, as soon as the purpose for which they
were bailed shall be answered. These contracte, then, all imply
a delivery from the bailor to the bailee and a redelivery From the
bailee to the bailor or his order. Now in locatio-conductio operis
faciendi, there is usually a delivery and a redelivery: for instance,
goods are delivered to an innkeeper to be kept, or to a carrier to be
transported, or materiale are delivered to a manufacturer to be
fashioned, and these goods and materials are to be redelivered at
another time, or in another place, or in an altered form. It is this
delivery and redelivery to which the Latin language always looks
exclusively in fixing on the persons to be denoted respectively by
the words locator and conductor3 and, accordingly, by locator it
denotes the bailor, and by conductor the bailee‚ without regarding
the fact that while in locatio-conductio rei or operarum the locator
supplies a service for which the conductor pays the price, in locatio-
condnctio operis faciendi itis the locator who pays the price and
the conductor who performs the service.

ColonuS, or the independent person who entered into a contract

of locatio-conductio respecting land, must be distinguished from the
colonus who mainly composed the agricultural population under the
empire. Colonatus, the condition of the latter colonus, is an insti-
tution whose origin is obscure, but which probably began to be
common as early as A. D. 200. Colonatus was not a mere obligation
⁴or jus in personam, but a real right or jus in rem, and may be
regarded as a new form of dependent status, a condition of subjec-
