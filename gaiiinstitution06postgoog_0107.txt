the general rule of gentile law, should be born a Roman citizen; but

this would contravene the above-mentioned lex Mensia, which en- fu·- ·

acted that the issue of a marriage is an alien whenever either parent
is an alien. We may from this passage conjecture that what Ulpian
calls the lex Mensia (a law not elsewhere quoted) was identieal with
what Gaius calls the senatusconsult of Hadrian, and was a compre-
hensive ordinance, regulating· the conditione and effect of gentile

marriages.

civitate Romana donatusfuerit, non
aliter filii in potestate eius fiunt,
quam si I mperator cos in potestatem
redeqerit. quod ita demum ιε facit,
si causa cognita aestimaverit hoc
filiis expedire. diligentius atque
exactius mim causam cognoscit de
impuberibus absentibusque. et haec
ita edicto divi Hadriani significan·-

ξ 94. Item si quis cum uxore
praegnante civitate Romana donatus
sit, quamvis is qui nascitur, ut supra
diximus, civis Romanus sit, tamen
in potestate patris non fit: idque
subscriptione divi Hadriani signifi-
catur. qua de causa qui intellegit
uxorem suam esse praegnatem, dum
civitatem sibi et uxori ab Impera-
tore petit, simul ab eodem petere
debet, ut eum qui natus erit in
potestate sua habeat.

the power of the father except by
express ordinance of the emperor,
which he only makes if, on hearing
the facts of the case, he deems it
expedient for the interest of the
children, and only after a careful
and minute inquiry if they are in·
fauts and absent, as an edict of the
Emperor Hadrian intimates.

§94. Also if an alien and his

pregnant wife receive a grant of ‚

Roman citizenship, the child, though

,a Roman citizen, as above men-

tioned, is not boni ιιι the power of
his father according to a rescript of
the late Emperor Hadrian, where-
fore‚ if he knows his wife to be
pregnant, an alien who petitione
the emperor for the Roman fmu-
chise for himself and his wife ought
at the same time to petition that
his son may be subjected to his

power.

§95. The rule is different for
Latius who with their children are
made citizens of Rome, for their
children fall under their power, and
a similar right is conceded to cer-
tain aliens under the denomination
of greater Latinity.
