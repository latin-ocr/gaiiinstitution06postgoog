108 DE PERsoms‘. [ι. §5 116-123.

bondsman became ingenuus, whereas the manumitted slave became
libertinus. Bondage did not exist in the time of J ustinian.

ᾧ 119. Τ116 libripens must not be dumb, Ulpian, 20, 7: probably
because he had to utter the formula preserved by Festus, Raudus-
culo libram ferit0, i.e.. to invite the emptor to striks the scale with
the ingot, in order to show by the ring that the metal was genuine.

ᾗ 120. Under the first emperors the body of the Roman world
consisted of three memberS, the imperial city, Rome, Italy, and the
provinces, the two former being highly privileg-ed in comparison
with the third. After the Social War all Italy had acquin-ed the
Roman franchise, but Italic soil was not a purely local appellation,
as jus Italicum was conceded to many provincial cities. J us Itali-
cum, or Italian privileges, implied (1) a free municipal constitution
with elective magistrates (generally called duumviri juri dicundo)
possessed of independent jurisdiction3 and, what was still more
important, (2) immunity from direct taxation, whether in the form
of capitation tax (tributum capitis), imposed on all who were not
holders of land (tributarii), or in the form of land tax (tributum
agri), imposed on holders of land (possessores), and paid in provinces
of the people to the aerarium under the name of stipendium, in
provinces of the emperor to the fiscus under the name of tributum,
2, ξ 21. Italic soil was (3) subject to Quiritary ownership (do-
minium ex jure Quiritium) and acquirable and transferable by
usucapion and mancipation. Under the later emperorS, as early as
the time of Diocletian‚ the Roman world was equalized‚ not by the
elevation of the depressed members, but by depression of those
formerly favoured: Italy was shorn of her privileges, and all the
empire became provincial.

ᾗ 122. Chemical analysis shows that the aes of which Roman
coins consisted was bronze, a mixture of copper (cuprum), tin, and
lead. Brass, a mixture of copper and calamine (cadmeia) or zinc,
was called orichalcum. Silver currency was first introduced Β.0.

ᾧ 123. As coemptio was a form of mancipatiO, how does it happen
that manua, the result of coempti0, differs from mancipium, the
result of mancipatio ⁴? Because, Gaius answers, the formula of
words used in the mancipatio that entered into coemptio was speci-
fically different from the formula employed on other occasions of
mancipation.
