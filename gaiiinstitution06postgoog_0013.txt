PREFAOE. vii

pre-eminent auctoritas, or exclusive legislative authority, equal to
that of four other jurists, Papinian, Ulpian‚ Paulus, and Modestinus,

Besides his Institutione, Gaius was the author of many other
treatiseS, of which fragments are preserved in the Digest, and some
of which are alluded to by Gaius in the Institutione. For instance,
he wrote a treatise on Edictum Urbicum, 1 ἧ 188, which, as
opposed to Edictum Provinciale, probably embraced the edicte of
the Praetor urbanus, the Praetor peregrinus, and the Aedilis
curulis3 a commentary on the Twelve Tables, another on the lex
Papia Poppaeag' another on the works of Quintus Mucius, besides
a treatise on Res quotidianae, and the above-named treatise on
Sc. Orphitianum and another on Sc. Tertullianum.

The name of the recently discovered work does not appear in the
MS. 3 but from the proem to J ustinian’s Institutes appears to have
been INSTITUTIONES, or to distinguish it stom the systema of Rhe-
toric which also bore this name, mswrunonss mms onnus. From
the way in which it is mentioned by J ustinian, we may infer that
for 350 years the e'lite of the youth of Rome were initiated in
the mysteries of jurisprudence by the manual of Gaius, much as

English law studente have for many years commenced their ’

labours under the auspices of Blackstone. It is probably in
allusion to the familiarity of the Roman youth with the writings
of Gaius that J ustinian repeatedly calls him (e. g. Inst. proem, 6 3
Inst. 4, 18, 53 and in the constitution prefixed to the Digest, and
addressed ad Antecessores, ἦ l), ‘our friend Gaius’ (Gaius noster).
The shortness of the time that sufficed Tribonian and his colleagues
for the composition of J ustinian’ s Institutes (apparently a few
months towards the close of the three years devoted to the com-
pilation of the Digest, Inst. proem) is less surprising when we
see how closely Tribonian has followed the arrangement of Gaius,
and how largely, when no change of legislation prohibiwd, he has
appropriated his very words.

Certain internal evidences, as already noticed, fix the date at
which portions of the Institutions were composed. 'Phe emperor
Hadrian is spoken of as Departed or Deceased (Divus) except in
1 ξ 47 and 2 ᾧ 57. Antoninus Pius is sometimes (1 ἧ 53, l ᾖ 102)
named without this epithet, but in 2 ξ 195 has the style of Divus.
Marcus Aurelius was probably named, 2 ξ 126, and the Institutions
were probably published before his death, for 2 ἧ 177, as above

mentioned, contains no n‘otice of a constitution of his, recorded by
