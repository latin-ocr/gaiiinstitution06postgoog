§45 In an action with a formula in factum concepta, the In-
tenti0‚ Si paret fecisse, ‘If it appear that the defendant has done
this or that '—‘ If the defendant's act place him in a certain class,'
corresponds to the minor premiss of a syllogism of which the con-
clusion is: ( Τ11611 this defendant is under such and such an obliga-
tion to this plaintiffi' or ‘ This defendant is condemnable to perform
such and such a service to this plaintiffi' The major premiss will
be: ‘ All persons who have done such and such an act,’ or, ‘ who
belong to such and such a class, are under 311611 31111 311611 311
obligation‚’ or ‘ are compellable to render such 31111 311611 3 service
to such and such 3 plaintiff! This major premiss 13 withdrawn from
discussion, 13 not permitted to be disputed3 31111 the issue in such
311 action 6311 only relate to the minor premiss; in other wordS, 13
always 311 133116 of fact.

In an actio with 3 formula in jus concepta, the intentio, Si paret
oportere, ‘ If it appear that the defendant 13 11111161 311611 31111 311611
311 obligation,' corresponds to the conclusion of a syllogism of which
the minor premissis: ‘The defendant belongs to such 31111 311611 3
61333 :’ and the major: ‘ All persons belonging to such 31111 311611
3 61333 316 11111161 311611 31111 311611 311 obligat-ion! The major premiss
may be an alleged rule either of law or of equity‚ a proposition
either of civil law or of praetor-ian law3 and in neither case 13 it with·
drawn from discussion. The issue, that is to say, in an action with
a formula in jus concepta may either relate to the minor or to the
major premiss: may be either an issue of fact or an issue of law.

The following passage of Cicero speaks of actions whose formula
was iu jus concepta with the additional terms, ex fide bona or the like3
and which therefore involved an issue of equity or praetorian laxv.
Privata enim judicia maximarum quidem rerum in juris eonsul-
torum mihi videntur esse prudentia. . . . In omnibus igitur iis
judiciis in quibus Ex 11113 BONA est additum ; ubi vero etiam 111 Ima

quon AEQUIUS MELIUS, parati esse debent. Illi enim dolum malum,
