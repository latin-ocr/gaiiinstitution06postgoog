111. ἕξ isa-208] DE FURTIS. 461

ᾗ 193. We must distinguish between furtum conceptum and
furtum lance et licio conceptum. Ea quoque furta quae per lancem
liciumque concepta essent, proinde ac si manifesta forent, vindica-
verunt, Gellius, 11, 18, 9. ‘ Possession of stolen goods discovered
on search with the platter and girdle was punished as theft detected
in the act.'

Traces of the word ⁶ conceptum' occur in a fragment of
the Twelve Tables: Tignum junctum aedibus vineaeque et
concapet ne solvito, ‘ Timber built into a house or vineyard of
another man and discovered there by the owner must not be
severed:’ where et concapet represents either et conceptum or
qui concipiet.

The search with a platter and girdle was probably a custom
derived from Greece, for a similar formality is described by Plato,
LegeS, 12, 7.

In the later period of Roman law, as in modern Europe, the
search for stolen goods was not conducted by the private party but
by public officerS. In England the object is effected by a search
warrant. Upon the information on oath that a party has probable
cause to suspect that his goods have been stolen, and are concealed
in a certain dwelling-house‚ and on his shewing the cause of his
suspicion, a justice of the peace may grant a warrant authorizing to
enter and search for the said goodS, and to attach the goods and the
party in whose custody they are found, and bring them before him,
that he may give an account how he came by them, and be dealt
with according to law. The warrant is directed to a constable or
other public officer and not to any private person, though it is
proper that the party complaining should be present and assistant
because he knows his goodS. As touching the party that had
custody of the goodS, if they were stolen, but not by him but by
another that sold and delivered them to him (furtum oblatum),
if it appear that he was ignorant that they were stolen, he may
be discharged as an offender and bound over to give evidence as
a witness against him that sold them.

ᾧ 195. The same definition of theft is given by Paulus. Fur
est qui dolo malo rem alienam contrectat, Sent. R. 2, 31, 1. ‘ A
thies is he who with evil intention handles (lifts, moves, touche8,)
the property of another.’ J ustinian gives a different definition.
Furtum est contrectatio rei fraudulosa, lucri faciendi causa vel
ipsius rei, vel etiam usus ejus possessionisve, Inst. 4, 1, 1. ‘ Thest
