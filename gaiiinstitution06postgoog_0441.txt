‘ Auctoritas is an action on eviction against the vendor.' Caia Seia
fundum a Lucio Titio emerat et, quaestione mota fisci nomine,
auctorem laudaverat, et, evictione secuta, fundus ablatus et fisco
adjudicatus est, venditore praesentes Quaeritur, cum emptrix non
provocaverit, an venditorem possit convenire. Herennius Modes-
tinus respondit: Sive, quod alienus fuerit quum veniret, sive, quod
tunc obligatus, evictus est, nihil proponi cur emptrici adversus
venditorem actio non competat, Dig. 21, 23 73, 1. ‘ Caia Seia
bought an estate of Lucius Titius, and being sued by the imperial
treasury, vouched the vendor to warrant her title, and was evicted
in his presence. Consulted, whether, by not appealing, the pur-
chaser had lost her action for breach of warranty‚ Modestinus
advised that, whether evicted by a proprietor or by a mortgagee,
there was nothing in the facts proposed to deprive the purchaser os
her remedy against the vendor.'

A sale was often accompanied by stipulations binding the vendor
to repay twice the purchase—money in case of eviction, or in case
the article sold was returned for unsoundness (duplae stipulatio).
In the absence of express warranty the English law, applying the ·
rule of Caveat emptor, except in the sale for a fair price of goods in
the possession of the vendor, refuses to assume an implied warranty
or covenant of title, or, except in certain exceptional circumstances,
to assume an implied warranty of the goodness or soundness of the
articles sold. But by Roman law, in the absence of such stipula-
tions, warranty of the title and quality of the goods was held to be
inherent in the contract of sale. In the case of faults of quality
the purchaser could either recover part of the purchase-money by
actio aestimatoria, or rescind the contract by actio redhibitoria.

By English law mere inadequacy of price affords no ground for
setting aside a sale, unless it be so gross as to afford a necessary
presumption of fraud and imposition, and then a court of equity will
grant relief. By Roman law a vendor could rescind a contract 'for
the sale of land on proof that the purchasffimoney was only half the
value, Cod. 4, 44, 2.

Peculiar to the English law of sale is the provision of the Statute
of Fraude, that contracts for the sale of lands must be in writ-ing
sig-ned by the party to be charged: and contracts for the sale of
goods for the price cf ,ἒ 10 and upwards are not good unless in
writing signed by the party to be charged, or unless the buyer
