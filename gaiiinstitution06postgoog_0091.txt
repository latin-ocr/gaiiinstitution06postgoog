his father, not being responsible for his son's debts, would not be
interested in the recovery of the thing, and therefore was not
entitled to sue the depositary or borrower: the son, however, would
be answerable to the original lender or letter, and accordingly was
allowed to sue in his own name. To avoid, however, contravening
the civil law by affirming a proprietary right vested in a filiusfamilias,
he did not sue ΒΥ a formula in jus concepta, i.e. of the form, si
paret oportere, ‘ if the plaintiff establish a right,’ but by a formula
in factum, of the form, si paret factum esse, ‘ if the plaintiff establish
a fact! It is remarkable that Gaius instances precisely the actio
commodati and the actio depositi as having two forms, one in
jus and another in factum (4 §4733 and we may conjecture that the
latter was invented to be used under these very circumstances by
filiusfamilias.

b. The latter periods of Roman law present a gradual emanci-
pation of filiusfamilias by successive inventious of new kinds of
peculium. As early as the time of Augustus the earnings of a
filiusfamilias in military service were called castrense peculium and
belonged to him in absolute proprietorship. Filiifamilias in castrensi
peculio viee patrumfamiliarum funguntur, Dig. 4, 6, 2. ‘A filius-
familias in respect of his military acquisitions has the right of a
paterfamilias? Subsequently the earnings of filiifamilias in the
civil service of the State, in holy erdem, in the liberal professione,
were assimilated 'w their earnings in the army, under the name of
peculium quasi castrense. Further, whatever came to the son from
his mother or from the maternal line, or from any source but the
paternal estate, was called peculium adventicium, and in this the
father had only a usufruct or life estate, while the son had tbe
reversion in see (proprietas). Only such peculium as was derived
from the paterna] estate (ex re patris) continued, under the name of
peculium profecticium‚ subject to the old rules and belonged in
absolute property to the father.

The Gallie racc, of which the Galatians were a branch, are men-
tioned ΒΥ Caesar as having the institution of patria potestas: Viri
in uxores, sicuti in liberos, vitae necisque habent potestatem, De
Bello Gall. 6, 19. ‘ Husbands and fathers have power of life and
death over wives and children.’ St. Paul in his Epistle to the
Galatians alludes to the peculiarity of their law: ‘ 'I'he heir, as long

as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord
of all ;’ 4, 1 .
