either unaoeompanied by actions or accompanied. An instance
of the former class is the exceptio rei judicatae when judgment
in a vindicatio is given in favour of the possessor. This merely
denies the right of the plaintiff without affirming the right of
the defendant, and therefore cannot be used by the defendant as
a ground of action: but it may be employed by the defendant as
a means of defence against the plaintiff or his successor after any.
lapse of years.

An instance of exception accompanied by action is exceptio⁸
metue, which belongs to a defendant who may, if he chooses, be a
plaintiff in an actio metus. ’

Savigny holds, ᾧ 249, that such exceptions are imprescriptible3
but the better opinion seems to be that they have the same duration

as the right of action (in the words of the French jurists: Tant ο

dure l’action, tant dure ,l'exception): for the reason alleged for
making exceptione imprescriptible: Is cum quo agitur non habet
potestatem quando conveniatur, Dig. 44, 4, 5, 6, the inability of
the person armed with the exception to fix when the matter shall
be litigated, is inapplicable when the same person is also armed
with a right of action. Vangerow, § 151.

,ἕ 111. The rule for the duration of actions is as follows: purely

restorative or remedial actions (quae rei persecutionem habent) i. e. ἶ

actions where there is neither gain for the plaintiff nor loss for the

defendant, but the patrimony of each is left at its original level, ³².

Penal actions (poenae persecutoriae), both those where there is
no gain to the plaintiff but possibly a loss to the defendant (indem-

nificatory or unilaterally penal actions), as well as those where if ‚²

judgment passes for the plaintiff there is enrichment for the ἰ
plaintiff and impoverishment for the defendant (bilaterally penal '

actions) are nup-pal.

Thus the actio⁸ doli mali, if brought for complete indemnification,
was annual: but ifthe damages were limited to the amount gained
by the defendant, in which case the action was rei persecutoria, it
was perpetual, Dig. 4, 3, 28.

When-‘3 right of action was limited to a year, this was an
annus utilis, that is, a year of dies utiles, of days open to juris-3
diction, and on which the plaintiff was not hindered by any insur-
mountable obstacle, such as absence of plaintiff or defendant, illness
of plaintiff and inability to appoint a procurator, Dig. 44, 3, 1. An
