PRELIMINARY DEFIN'ITIONS. 13

aimless dictate of a passing emotion or initiate the execution of a
many-stepped or many-staged and long-considered plan.

Having fixed the meaning of Volition‚ we have materials for the
definition of Intention‚ which is a correlative of Volition‚ In
popular language Intention always implies the contemplation of an
end. As a condition of responsibility it denotes the contemplation
of the immediate consequences of those muscular movements which
are the objects of Volition or determined by Will, The simplest
action is a complication of a multitude of muscular movements
produced by a multitude of Volitions. Suppose that certain com-
plicated muscular movements, the lifting of a pistol, the taking
aim at a man, the pulling the trigger, are the antecedente of a
certain event, namely, that a man is shot. If this end was contem-
plated, the shooting was intentional. Intention is the contempla-
tion of the consequence or end of bodily movements, and the belief
or expectation that it will ensue. Or we may define it the com-
bination or co-ordination of bodily movements to a contemplated
and expected or anticipated end.

Intention sometimes denotes a remote or ulterior end, the ulti-
mate motive of a series of subordinate ends3 but for our present
purpose it is confined to the immediate consequences of those
muscular movements which are the objects of Volition‚ These
consequences, according to our definition of Will, are not willed,
but intended. 'I'he movements, being consequences of the volitions,
that is, standing to them in the relation of end to mean, may be said
to be both willed and intended. In the generic sense of Will and
Volition‚ the consequent is wished, desired, willed (ὀρεκτόν, αἱρετόν)
as well as the antecedent. Two cases may be distinguished: the
consequent may be the very motive or inducement of an act, and
then without doubt it is desired: or it may be of itself regarded
with aversion, and occasioned with reluctance‚ and willed only so far
as it is the inexorable condition of some other event which has been
determined. But even in this case it may be said to be desired: it
is a mischief which the actor would fain avoid inflicting, but he
prefers to cause it rather than forego some other object which he has
resolved to attain. (So Aristotle decides in the case of the throwing
overboard of cargo to save a ship from wreck, Eth. Nic. 3, 1.)

Intention being defined, Negligence, the negation of intention
and alternative ground of responsibility‚ will be more easily com-
prehended. An actor is negligent when he is ignorant of the
