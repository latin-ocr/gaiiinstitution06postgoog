tion of the moral code, to the forum of conscience, to the sanction

of public opinion, at a time when it was felt that the immense ’

conlidence implied in a loan sor consumption could only exist under
the aegis of positive law.

When the short, sharp, and decisivo remedy of a civil action had
once been invented for mutui datio, the ingenuity of contracting
parties and jurists would soon extend the remedy to other relations
by means of a fiction of mutui datio· Expensilation‚ then, and
Stipnlation may be regarded as artifices for transferring conven-
tione, originally perhaps, from the ethical code to the legal code3
but certainly, in later time8‚ from tbe laxer equitable code to the
more rigorous civil code. A great part, however, of human dealings
refuses to be governed by pre-determined conditions‚ and pre-
arranged‚ pre-capitulated stipulatione. Hence alongside of stipulatio
and expensilatio existed Real and Consensual contracts; along-side
of Condictio existed J udicis arbitrive postulatio; alongside of for-
mulae stricti juris existed formulae ex fide bona.

The general difference between actiones stricti juris and actiones
ex fide bona consisted in the greater latitude of discretion allowed
to the judge in the latter. 'Phe principal speeiflc points of difference
were the following:

(a) Actiones stricti juris are based on unilateral contractS, which
only ground an action for one of the parties: actiones ex fide bona
are based on bilateral contracte, on which both parties can bring
actio directa3 or on semi-bilateral contracts, on which one party can
bring actio directa, and the other actio contraria. ·So one-sided
were condictions or actions stricti juris that before the time of Marcus
Aurelius a set-off or counterclaim of the defendant (compensatio)
could not be pleaded, even in the form of Exceptio, Inst. 4, 6, 30.

(b) Actions stricti juris are governed by a literal interpretation of
the words of a disposition z in actions ex fide bona the judge inquires
what was the true intention of the parties; he attends not only to
express but also to implied terms of a convention, Dig. 3, 5, 7, and,
to ascertain these, takes notice of local usageS, Dig. 21, 1, 31, 20. As
we distinguish between the Volition or overt act of a delinquent and
his Intention, so bona fides distinguishes between the expressions of
contractors or the lawgiver and their intentions. Strictum jus adheres
to a grammatical or literalistic interpretation of a disposition, and
assumes that words exactly coi-respond to intentions. It is then called
summum jus: e.g. Verbis et literis et summo jure contenditur, Cicero.
