rights are antecedent to wrong, and may be divided into status,
primordial rights, property, and obligation ; the title or investitive
fact which creates them being a condition defining a status or
capacity of primordial rights, or one of the modes of acquiring
property or of forming a contraet. Secondary or sanctioning rights
imply an antecedent wrong, and their title is a breach of eon-
tract or the violation of some real right, statistic, primordial, or
proprietary.

Both these classes of rights and the corresponding duties are
creations of the law: for every law is both imperative and punitory ;
that is, both ΒΥ its command confers a primary right and imposes a
corresponding primary duty, and sanctions its command by con-
ferring a secondary right and imposing a secondary duty, that is,
by conferring a remedy and imposing a punishment (if punish-
ment, besides penal execution, which it denotes in the next sentence,
may include mere restitution or compensation) in the event of
disobedience.

The sanctione of the civil law are either reparative and remedia]
or penal and preventive3 in one case the object of the law is the
BESTORATION of the plaintiff by restitution or compensation, and
then his primary right is generally the measure of his redress or
sanctioning right3 in the other case it is the repression of similar
wrongs ΒΥ inflicting an exemplary Pumsnumvr on the defendant
which may operate as a terror to other wrong-doers; and then
the sanctioning right may far exceed his primary right. That even
REerRA‘rION often exceeds the primary right appears from p. 472.

'Phe language of Roman jurisprudence makes no distinction be-
tween a primary right and a sanctioning right when the sanction is
purely RESTORATIVE, even though the restoration exceed the primary
right, calling both by the name of the 'Phing (Res). The redress
directly given by the Roman law was always pecuniary compensa-
tion, and we might have expected Roman jurists above all others
to distinguish between the plaintiff’s primary and secondary right3
but the indirect result of a real action might be the recovery of
specific restitution, and it was in view of this type of redress that
the Roman lawyers were led to speak of primary and sanctioning
proprietary rights as identical.

If we next proceed to inquire what classes of actions are brought
for reparation or the recovery of property (rei persecutio), and what
for the recovery of a penalty (poenae persecutio), we shall have no
