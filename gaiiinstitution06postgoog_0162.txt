As women were capable of administration, the functions of the
guardian, which in the case of infante were either administrative
or sanctionative, in the case of women were confined to sanctioning.

but those of their heirs apparent, their agnates. Originally the
authorization of the guardian was not sufficient to validate the will
of an independent woman: it was necessary that she should first

of a coemption (with her guardian’s sanction) and subsequent re-
mancipation and manumission. She then, with the sanction of the
manumissor, in his character of fiduciary guardian, could make a
valid will. In the time of GaiuS‚ Hadrian having abolished the
necessity of coemption‚ to make a valid will an independent woman
