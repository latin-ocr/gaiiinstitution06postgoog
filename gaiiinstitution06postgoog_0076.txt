mulgated ΛΑ). 506 by Alaric II, king of the Visigoths of Spain and
Gaul, contained, besides extract-‚s from the codex Theodosianus
(promulgated Aa). 436), a selection from the Sententiae of Paulus
and an epitome of these institutes of Gaius. From this epitome it
appears that in the paragraphs now obliterated Gaius proceeded to
explain the modes of private manumission by which a slave became
Latinus J unianus, and instanced writing (per epistolam), attestation
of witnesses (inter amicos), invitation of the slave to sit with other
guests at the table of his master (convivii adhibitione).

The lex J unia Norbana, probably passed in the reign of Tiberius,
Aa). 19, fifteen years after the lex Aelia Sentis, in the consulate of
Marcus J unius Silanus and Lucius Norbanus Balbus, defined and
modified the status conferred by such acts of private manumission,
converting Praetoris tuitione liber into ipso jure liber, or possessio
libertatis into genuine libertas3 with, however, sundry grievous
stints and deductions. Under this statute the freedman was nomi-
nally assimilated to Latinus coloniariuS, the citizen of a Roman colony
in Latium3 that 1s, had a moiety of the private rights composing
civitas Romana or jus Quiritium, possessing commercium without

s connubium. As incapable of connubium or civil marriage, the

'f Latinus was incapable of patria potestas over his children and of
agnatio or civil relationship. Though incapable of civil marriage
he was of course capable of gentile marriage (matrimonium, uxorem
liberorum quaerendorum causa ducere) and of natural relationship
(cognatio), just as an alien (peregrinus), though, by want of com-
mercium, incapable of dominion ex jure Quiritium, was capable
of bonitary ownership (in bonis habere) under the jus gentium.

In virtue of commercium, the Latinus J unianus was capable of
Quiritary ownership, of civil acquisition and alienation (usucapiO,
mancipatio, in jure cessio), contract (obligatio), and action (condictio,
vindicatio), like a Roman citizeu3 but in respect of testamentary
succession his rights were⁶ very limited. He was said to have
testamentary capacity (testamentifactio)‚ Ulpian, 20, 93 but this
only meant that he could perform the part of witness, or familiae
emptor, or libripens (2 ξ 104), i. e. could assist another person to ’
make a valid will; not that he could take under a will either as
heir or as legatee‚ or could dispose of his own property by will,
Ulpian, 20, 14. At his death all his property belonffid to his
patron, as if it were the peculium of a slave, 3 ᾗ 56. Ιιι fact, as
J ustinian says: Licet ut liberi vitam suam peragebant, attamen
