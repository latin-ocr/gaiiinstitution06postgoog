is convenient that different grounds
of invalidity should have different
names to distinguish them, we will
say that some wills are unduly exe-
cuted, others duly executed but

subsequently vacated or subse-
quently annulled.

§138 The innovations of J ustinian changed the effecte of
adoption. Under his enactment, if a child is adopoed by an
ascendant the old rules obtain3 but a person adopted by a
sti-anger only acquires rights in the adoptive family in case of
the adopter's intestacy, and therefore need not be instituted or
disinherited by the adoptet ; he retainS, however, his rights in
his natural family, and therefore must be instituted or disin-
herited in the will of his natural parent.

§139. By English law the only circumstance by which a will
is avoided (besides revocation, cancellation, execution of a later
will), is the'marriage of the testator, and this operates universally,
irrespeetively of the birth of children.

ᾗ 140. This was reversed before the time of J ustinian, for we find
in D. 2, 38, 18, that the institution of the future adoptive son saves
a will from being ruptured by adoption. Indeed‚ considering that
the object of the lex Velleia was to save wills from rupture, we may
be surprised that the extension of its provisions from the natural

postumi to the artificial postumi or quasi postumi had not been
established in the days of Gaius,

ξ 147. Wills are not altogether
inoperative either when originally
informal or when at first valid and
subsequently vacated orannulled 3 for
if the seals of seven witnesses are at-
tached, the testamentary heir is enti-
tled to demand juxta-tabular posses·
sion, or possession in accordancewith
the will, if the testator was a citizen
of Rome and in his own power at the
time of his death 3 but if the cause
of nullity was the testator's subse-

liberty, or adoption and he dies an
