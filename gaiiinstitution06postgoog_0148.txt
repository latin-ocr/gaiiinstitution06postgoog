126 DE PERsoms [ι. §5 159-164.

not positive3 but in Rome the law of honour, as the law of reli-
gion in most modern states, was partially taken up into positive
legislation. The public sentiments of esteem and disesteem‚ that is
to say, were armed with political sanctione, and thus certain pro·
eeedings were discouraged which were not otherwise prohibited by
positive law, and the due application of these sanctione· was the
function of a special organ appointed by the legislator. This organ
was the censor, who had both a discretionary power of branding a
man with ignominy by an annotation against his name in the
civic register (notatio, subscriptio censoria), and, as revisor of the
lists of the senate, the knights, and the tribes, enforced the dis-
abilities of infamy by removing the infamous person from any of
those bodies. As the Comitia Centuriata, as well as the Comitia
Tributa, had in later times been connected with the division into
tribes, the tribeless man (aerarius) forfeited his vote and became
incapable of military service, Livy, 7, 2. These graver conse-
quences of infamy were not in the discretion of the censor, but
governed by strict rules of consuetudinary law (jus moribus intro-
ductum). Infamy was the consequence of condemnation in any
criminal trial (publicum judicium); in certain civil actions founded
on delict, thest, rapine, outrage, fraud; or on certain contracts‚
such as partnership‚ agency (mandatum), deposit3 or on quasi
contract, such as guardianship3 or of insolvency (bona possessa,
proscripta, vendita); or, without any judicial condemnation, was
annexed to certain violatione of the marriage laws, such as bigamy
or the marriage of a widow before the termination of her year of
mourning, and to the pursuit of certain professions, such as that of
stage-player or gladiator. In some of these latter instanees con-
suetudinary law, as above intimated, inflicted positive sanctions on
acts that originally had only been prohibited by the sanctionless
law of honour. In view of these consequences, iufamia may at one
time have been regarded as capitis minutio. Cicero pro Quinctio
speaks of a suit involving existimatio as a causa capitis, and 'Pertul-
lian, the father of the Church, who was noted sor his knowledge of
Roman law, and possibly was identical with the jurist of that name,

⁶ of whom five fragments are preserved in the Digest, speaks of infa-

mia as capitis minuti0‚ De Spectaculis, 22. But the political rights
of civitas had ceased to be of importance under the emperors, and
we are expressly told m the Digest t-hat infamy did not constitute
a status mutatio, Dig. 50, 16, 103.
