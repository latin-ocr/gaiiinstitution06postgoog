11. ξς 185-19Ο.] DE HEREDIBUS INSTITUENDIS.

unus menn imamque ssw, vel
nense manneus mro.

ξ 187. Nam si sine libertate heres
institutus sit, etiam si postea manu-
missus fuerit a domino, heres esse
non potest, quia institutio in per·
sona eius non constitit ; ideoque
licet alienatus sit, non potest iussu
domini cernere hereditatem.

ξ 188. Cum libertate vero heres
institutus, si quidem in eadem causa
manserit, fic ex testamento liber
idemque necessarius heres. si vero
ab ipso testatore manumissus fuerit,
suo arbitrio hereditatem adire po-
test. quodsi alienatus sit, iussu
novi domini adire hereditatem debet,
et ea ratione per eum dominus fit
heres: nam ipse alienatus mque
heres neque liber esse potest.

ξ 189. Alienus quoque servus
heres institutus, si in eadem causa
duraverit, iussu domini hereditatem
adire debet; si vero alienatus fuerit
ab eo, aut vivo testatore aut post
mortem eius antequam adeat, debet
iussu novi domini cernere. si ma-
numissus cst antequam adeat, suo
arbitrio adire hereditatem potest.

§ 190. Si autem servus alienus
heres institutus est vulgari cretione
data, ita intellegitur dies cretionis
cedere, si ipse servus scierit se here-
dem institutum esse, nec ullum
impedimentum sit, quominus certio-
rem dominum faceret, ut illius iussu
cernere possit.

following manner: ‘ Stichus, my
slave, be free and be my heir 3 ’ or,
‘ Be my heir and be free!

ξ 187. If he is not enfranchised
at the same time that he is insti-
tuted, no subsequent manumission
by his owner enables him to take
the succession, because the institu-
tion is originally void, and if aliened
he cannot declare his acceptance by
the order of the alienes.

§ 188. When a slave is simul-
taneously instituted and enfran-
chised, if he continue in the same
condition, the will converte him
into a freeman and a necessary heir:
if the testator himself manumits
him in his lifetime, he may use his‘
own discretion about acceptance:
if he is aliened he must have the
order of his new master to accept,
and then his master through him
becomes successor, the alienated
slave himself becoming neither suc-
cessor nor free.

§ 189. When another person's
slave is instituted heir, if he con-
tinue in the same position, he must
have the order of his master to
accept the succession: if aliened
by him in the lifetime of the tes-
tator, or before acceptance, he must
have the order of the alienes to
accept: if manumitted before ac-
ceptance, he may follow his own
judgment as to accepting.

§ 190. When a slave of another
person is instituted heir with the
ordinary term allowed for delibera-
tion, the term only begins to run
when the slave has notice of his ap-
pointment, and is not disabled from
insol-ming his master so that he
may obtain his order for acceptance.

ᾧ 187. This rule was abolished by J ustiniam who enacted that
the enfranchisement of the testator's slave, though unexpressed,
should always be implied in his institution as heir.

ᾧ 188. J ustinian explains why the slave lost his liberty: Des-
