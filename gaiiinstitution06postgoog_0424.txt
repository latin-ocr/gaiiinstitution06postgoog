402 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [111. ἐξ 110-127.

deduced his title. But in questions of Obligation this course was
not open, for Obligation was not thus transferable. Novation or
Delegation might effect the purpose, 2 ᾧ 38, 3 § 176: but Dele-
gation required the concurrence of the debtor or adversary: and
Cession or Procuration, 2 ᾧ 39, we have assumed to be as yet un-
invented. · At this period, then, the only remaining available
representative in a suit concerning contractual obligation was a
person who had been concerned, though merely as an accessory,
ξ 126, in the original convention. Ihering, ᾧ 56. When the deve-
lopment of the law of mandate led to the frequent appointment of
a procurator, the adstipulator ceased to be necessary except for
securing performance of an act aster the death of the principal
promisee, ᾧ 117. He ceased to be necessary even for this purpose
when a stipulation for an act after the death of the stipulant was
decided to be valid, and accordingly the adstipulator has disappeared
from the legislation of J ustinian.

ᾧ 115. The adpromissor at different epochs of the law appears as
sponsor, fidepromissor, fidejussor. A sponsor could only intervene
when both parties were Roman citizens, a fidepromissor was used
when either party was a peregrinae, ᾧ 120. There is a striking
parallelism between the rules relating to a sponsor or fidepromissor
and those relating to an adstipulator. The obligation does not
pass to the heres, and the stipulation of the sponsor or fidepromissor
may be valid when that of the principal, though valid by J us
gentium, ·is by Civil law invalid; for instance, for a performance
after the death of the principal promisee. The sponsor and fide-
promissor can only be adj uncts to a stipulation, the fidejussor may
be employed to guaranty any obligation.

ᾧ 121. 'I'he lex Furia discharging the sponsor and fidepromissor
of liability in two years and limiting the liability of each to a
proportionate part, is supposed to have been enacted Β.ο. 95.

'Phe epistle of Hadrian (Aa). 117-138) left the fidejussor l'mble
originally (ipso jure) to the whole debt, with a counteractive right
(exceptio) to reduction, enforced by a clause in the formula, of which
the following passage appears to give the terms: Si contendat fide·
jussor caeteros solvendo esse, etiam exceptionem ei dandam: Si non
et illi solvendo sint, Dig. 46, 1, 28. ‘ The contention of a fidejussor
that his co-fidejussors are solvent may be expressed in an exception:
Unless such and such co-guarantors are solvent.' This privilege
of the fidejussor is called Beneficium divisionis.
