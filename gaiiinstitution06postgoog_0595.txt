nr. ξς ios-109] PENDENCY. 573

actio civilis opposed to interdictum, Dig. 43, 26, 14: and lex
opposed to praetor (actionum modus vel lege vel per praetorem
introductus), Dig. 50, 17, 27.

Although the division into judicia legitima and judicia imperio
continentia does not exacti y coincide with the division into
actiones legitimae and actiones honorariae (e. g. an actio in factum
if litigated at Rome before a Roman judex by two Romans would
be judicium legitimum, and, vice versa, an actio civilis if litigated
before recuperatore or in the provinces or between aliens would be
judicium imperio continens, ᾖ 109); yet it is essentially the same,
being based on the same antithesis of the Legislator and the
Executive.

Statutory actions (judicia legitima), so named from the lex J ulia
judiciaria, the statute by which they were defined, had by that
statute a pendency of eighteen months. After that period they
could neither be prosecuted nor renewed, as the right of action was
consumed by res in judicium deducta. If the delay was caused by
the defendant the plaintiff had a remedy by an action De dolo,
Dig. 4, 3, 18, 4. Actions binding (continentia) by magisterial
power had a still shorter pendency‚ the commission of the judex
only continuing in force so long as the praetor who appointed him,
and who himself was only appointed for a year, continued in
office.

It is difficult to reconcile this account of the prescription or limi-
tation of legal process with what we read of the duration of some
controversies. Martial speaks of a cause that had been litigated in
the three Fora, the Forum Romanum, the Forum J ulium, and the
Forum Augustum, for twenty years:

Lis te bis decimae numerantem frigora brumae
Conterit una tribua, Gargiliane, foris.

Ah miser et demens! viginti litigat annis
Quisquam cui vinci, Gargiliane, licet? 7, 65.

Bethmann-Hollweg, ᾖ 80, suggests that the limitation did not
apply to Centumviral suits nor to Cognitio extraordinaria3 and
that any litigation might be protracted by a series of apPeaIS.

This limit to the duration of legal proceedings, though it has
left some traces in the Digest, was obsolete long before J usti-
nian. Theodosius limited the pendency of actions to thirty years,
Cod. Theod. 4, 14, 1: i. e. he ordained that as the right of action
