11. ἓξ 65-79.] ADQUISITIONES DOMINII NATURALES. 203

jus in personam. 'I'he incorporeal obligation (jus in personam), is,
as it were, incorporated in a document, a subject of ownership (jus in
rem), and ownership of the document is deemed to be investitura
with the obligation. The omission of the Obligations (papers) now
resembles the jactus missilium3 the bank, company, or government,
that issues the obligationS, treats detention of the document as
presumptive evidence of ownership, and discharges its obligation by
paying whoever presente the paper for payment. In these con-
113013 the payee, promisee, or creditor, is only defined by the class
term ‘ bearer' 01· ‘ holder,' i. e. is an incerta persona, individually
unknown to the debtor before the moment of presentation.

One act of assent may suffice as the antecedent to many acts of
prehension3 for instance, in the acquisition (perceptio) of fruits by
a lessee (colonus) or usufructuary. Here the delivery (apprehensio)
occurs from time to time3 the will or intention of the original
proprietor was manifested once for 311 when he created the usu·
fruct or lease. If the fructus are res nec· mancipi, perception
gives the lessee dominion: if they are res mancipi, perception
gives the lessee bona fide possession, which usucapio will ripen
into dominion.

. Mere severance (separatio) of fruits (fructus) from the soil or
parent substance, without either constructive delivery (traditio) or
apprehension (perceptio), gives to the bona fide possessor, according
to Savigny, Besitz, 22 a, bona fide possession, which will be trans-
formed into property by usucapion: according to Vangerow‚ § 326,
it gives him immediate and plenary property.

If the true owner recovers the land or cattle by vindicatiO, the
judex will compel the bona fide possessor to restore the unconsumed
fruits (fructus extantes) but not to make compensation for the con·
sumed fruits (fructus consumpti). The mala. fide possessor, on the
contrary, acquires no property in the consumed fruits, but is com-
pelled either by the vindicatio by which the principal thing is
recovered or by a separate personal action (condictio) to restore
their value; he is compelled to restore the fructus extantes either
by the principa] vindicatio or by a separate vindicatio, He can be
sued for the value of the fruits he has neglected to gather (fructus
neglecti) only in the principal vindicatio: their non-existence pre-
vents his being sued for them in a separate vindicatio; and the
fact that he is not enriched by them prevents his being sued for

them in a separate condicti0‚ Savigny‚ System, ᾧ 267.
