1. ξς 108-115 a] DE MANU. 97

was only called materfamilias when subject to Hand: Genus est
uxor, ejus duae formae, una matrumfamilias, quae in manum conve-
nerant, altera earu-m quae tantummodo uxores habentur, Top. 4.
Gellius says the same: Idonei vocum antiquarum enarratores tradi-
derunt . . . . matremfamilias appellatam esse eam solam quae in
mariti manu mancipioque, aut in ejus in cujus maritus manu man-
cipioque esset, quoniam non in matrimonium tantum sed in familiam
- quoque mariti et in sui heredis locum venisset, Gellius, 18, 6.
‘ Competent interpretem of the ancient language say that mater-
familias was a title only given to a wife in the hand and mancipa-
tion of her husband, or of the person who held her husband in hand
and mancipation, as she was not only a wife, but a member of the
family of the husband, having acquired therein the status of self·
successor.' Boethius further limits the title to a wife who has
become subject to manus by coemption: Quae autem in manum
„per coemptionem convenerant, hae matresfamilias vocabantur, quae
vero usu et farreatione minime, ibid. However this may have
been, in one sense the name was a misnomer‚ for a wife subject to
hand was not sui juris (materfamilias), but alieni juris (filiafamilias) ε
and that materfamilias denoted a woman sui juris, whether married
or unmarried, as opposed to a filiafamilias or woman alieni juris,
appears from Ulpian: Sui juris sunt familiarum suarum principes,
id est paterfamilias itemque materfamilias, 4, 6.

If the wife was subject to the power of her father she required
his consent (auctoritas) before she could make a coemption with her
husband: Secundo capite legis J uliae de adulteriis permittitur patri
si in filia sua quam in potestate habet, aut in ea quae eo auctore,
cum in potestate esset, viro in manum convenerit, adulterum domi
suae generive sui deprehenderit, isque in eam rem socerum adhi-
buerit, ut is pater eum adulterum sine fraude sua occidat, ita ut
filiam in continenti occidat, Collatio, 4, 22. ‘ The second section
of the lex J ulia on adultery permits a father who finds his daughter,
who is in his power or with his consent in the hand of her husband,
committing adultery in his house or in the house of her husband, if
called in for the purpose by his son-in-law‚ to kill the adulterer with
impunity, provided that at the same time he also puts his daughter
to death.’ If the wife was independent of parental control, she
‚ required the sanction of her guardians, that is, her agnates‚ before
she could make a coemption with her husband: In manum con-
venerat usu an coemptione? Usu non potuit, nihil enim potest
