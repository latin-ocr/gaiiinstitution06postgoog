376 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [m. ἐξ 92-96.

stipulatu agitur, sed iure belli res ception, for the violation of a treaty

vindicatur. between sovereign states is not re-
dressed by the legal process of a
suit founded on stipulation‚ but by
martial process and the arbitrement
of the swerd.

cum quaeritur de iure Romanorum. that the rosus prescribed by law,
nam aput peregrinos quod iuris sit, under pain of nullification, for Con-
singularum civitatium iura requi· tracta, Wills, and any other Dispo-
rentes aliud in alia lege reperimus. sitions belong to the civil, National,

or Loca-l, as opposed to the Genfile,
Cosmopolitan, or Universal ingre-
diente of each particular code].

« ᾧ 92. Before we proceed to examine Formal, that is to say,

Verbal and Literal contracte, it is desirable, at the risk of some
repetition, to review the general nature of Title.

A Title is a fact, incident, or event, to which the law annexes

a right or obligation3 or it is a fact by which the law confers a
right or imposes an obligation on a person3 or it is an incident
through which the law invests a person with a right or obligation3
or, extending its function, it is an event which gives a beginning
or puts an end to a right or obligation; it is a fact, incident, or
event, whereby the law invests with a right or divests of a right3
or a fact, incident, or event, whereby the law bui-dens us with an
obligation or exonerates from an obligation.

When this fact is a lawful act designed to invest in the mode
prescribed or permitted by the legislator certain persons with
certain rights and obligationS, it is called a Disposition (Rechts-
geschaeft). Dispositions, e. g. contract, release, alienation‚ eman·
cipation, adoption, marriage, testation‚ succession, joinder in issue
(litis contestatio), διο. are as diversified in character as are the parts
of the statute book of which they are applications: but nevertheless
have many common or generic features which demand, what they
have not received in text books of English jurisprudence, a common
examination.

'I'he rights conferred through a title may be jura in rem, avail-
able against all the world, including both rights of status and
rights of property3 or jura in personam, available only against a
determinate person. It is with the latter that we are at present
concerned.
