168 DE REBUS sumone. [11. ξς 1-14.

respond to the Servitutes and jus in re aliena of Roman law.
But the principle: Servitutum non ea natura est ut aliquid faciat
quis, sed ut aliquid patiatur aut non faciat, D. 8, 1, 15, 1 τ ‘ Servi·
tudes are not a right to a performance but to a permission or
forbearance.:’ would exclude from the class of Servitudes some
members of the class of Incorporeal hereditaments; e. g. Rents,
which are said to lie in render, i. e. to involve a performance of
the party burdened, not in prender, i. e. not to consist in an act
of the party entitled. Roman law adhered strictly to the principle
that Real rigth, or rights against the world, can only correlate
to negative obligatione, duties of forbearance3 and that rights
correlating to positive obligations, or duties of performance‚ can
only be Persona13 i. e. can only regard a particular individual and
his universal successors.

Having described the various kinds of real right (jus in rem),
i. e. dominion and its fractions (jura in re), we proceed to the
mnas of real rights, that is to say, the events to which these
rights are annexed ΒΥ the legislator3 in other words, the modes
prescribed by the legislator by which such rights may be acquired3
in other words, the legislative definitions of the classes of persons
in whom such rights are declared to be vested.

The 'I'itles of real rights are divisible into 'I'itles by which single
real rights are acquired and Titles ΒΥ which aggregates of rights
(universitates jurum) are acquired.

'I'itles by which single real rights are acquired are divisible into
'I'itles sanctioned ΒΥ the civil law and 'Pitles sanctioned by natural
(gentile) law (jus gentium), natural law denoting the rules intro·
duced by praetors and jurists as consonant to the general reason
of mankind.

Titles by civil law are in jure cessio, usucapio, mancipatio, tra-
ditio, and others which will be mentioned. Titles ΒΥ natural law
are traditio, occupatio, accessio. and others which will be men-
tioned. We commence with Titles by civil law, and the intro-
ductory propositions which are now illegible in the manuscript
of Gaius may be supplied from Ulpian, Regulae, 19, 1, or Gaius,
1 120.

§Things are either mancipable or not mancipable. Things man-
cipable are land and houses on Italian soil, slaves, tame animals
employed for draught and carriage, as oxen, horses, mules, and
asses?
