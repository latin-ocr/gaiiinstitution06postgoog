jure manum consertum vocasti, inde ibi ego te revocO. . . . Suis
utrisque superstitibus praesentibus istam viam dico. Inite viam . . .
Redite viam . . . Quando te in jure conspicio . . . sed anne tu dicis ι
qua ex causa vindicaveris, Pro Murena, 12. ‘The estate in the j
Sabine land [between such and such boundaries] I claim as my
domain by the law of the Quirites. To determine this question

I challenge you to leave the court and join hands with me upon the
ground. 'Phe question which you challenge me to determine by
leaving the court and joining hands with you, that question Ι in
turn challenge you to determine by a meeting on the ground.

Ι command you both to go to the ground with your respective
witnesses. Proeeed. Return. Now that we meet in the presence of

the praetor, will you state what is the foundation of your claim ’.θ’

What was the exact nature of the Qanuum *cons-ertio? 'Phe Χ
words of Aulus Gellius are as follows: Vindicia, id est, correptio
manus in re atque in loco praesenti, apud Praetorem ex duodecim
tabulis fiebat, in quibus ita scriptum est, Si qui in jure manum
conserunt. Sed postquam praetores, propagatis Italiae finibuS, . . .
proficisci vindiciarum dicendarum causa in longinquas res grava-
bantur, institutum est . . . ut litigantes non iE-jpre apud praetorem ι
manum consererent, sed egr-jure manum consertum vocarent .....
‘atque profecti simul in agrum de quo litigabatur, terrae aliquid ex
ec, uti unam glebam, in jus in urbem ad praetorem deferrent, et in
ea gleba tanquam in toto agro vindicarent, Aulus Gellius, 20, 10.
From the conclusion of this passage we might suppose that the
manuum consertio was the joint-seizure of the object claimed which
Gaius describes in the case of movables ; but from the definition of
vindicia in the commmeement, manus correptio in re atque in
loco praesenti, ‘ grasping the hand on or over the subject claimed)
the object grasped seems to have been the hand of the adversary.

A similar ceremony formed a portion of the process of Wager
of battle in the old English law. ‘When the tenant in a Writ
of Right pleads that he bath more right to hold than the de-
mandant hath to recover, and offers to prove it by the body of
his champion, which tender is accepted by the demandant . . . a
piece of ground is in due time set out, of sixty feet square, enclosed
with lists, and on one side a court ereeted for the judges of the
court of Common Pleas, who attend there in their scarlet robes;
and also a bar is prepared for the learned sergeants at law. . . .
