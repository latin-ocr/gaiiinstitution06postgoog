524 DE AcrloNIBUS. [nr. ξς 39-44. ἓ

1116 formula is worded: Whereas Aulus Agerius was struck on the ,
cheek by the fist: the plaintiff is not compelled to declaro whether ¹,
he was struck 011 1116 right or left cheek, or whether with the right
or lest hand. And if 116 6116 for defamation, he must alleg-e the l
means, for so the formula is framed: Whereas Numerius Negidius
(hissed or) published a libel against Aulus Agerius with the purpose
of defamation.’

The absence of a demonstratio in the formula of condictio certi l
may be infel-red from the example given by Gaius, ἦ 86, and from
the assertion of Cicer0, Pro Roscio ComoedO, 4, that it did not
appear whether Fannius, who sued Roscius by condictio certi,
founded his claim 011 1111111ιὶ (10110, expensilatio, or stipulatio. He
could hardly have asserted this, if the title on which Fannius sued
had been expressed in a demonstratio, On the other hand, we have
a demonstratio in the condictio incerti, ᾗ 136, ᾧ 137. It is obvious
that if a man sues for an indeterminate sum of money 116 ought to
give the defendant some further information of the cause of action;
but if he sues for a determinate sum or a definite thing, the de-
fendant can scarcely be ignorant of the cause of action on which the
plaintiff 161166.

ᾗ 42. Τ116 adjudicatio was only found in the three actions familiae
erciscundae, communi dividundo, and finium regundorum. It was

not a declaration of existing property, but a transfer of property 1ο
0116 of the litigants from the other. Adjudicatione dominia nan-

ciscimur . . . nam si judex uni ex heredibus aut sociis aut vicinis rem
aliquam adjudicaverit, statim illi adquiritur sive mancipi sive 1166
mancipi sit, Ulpian, 19, 16. ‘ Adjudication is a transfer of domi-
nion‚ for the successor, partner, landowner, to whom a thing is
adjudicated by the judex, forthwith acquires property thei-ein,
whether it is mancipable or not mancipahle.' In quibus tribus
judiciis permittitur judici, rem alicui ex litigatoribus ex aequo et
bono - adjudicare, et, si unius pars praegravare videbitur, eum iu-
vicem certa pecunia alteri condemnare, Inst. 4, 6, 20. ‘ In these
three actions the judge has the power to assign a ,thing on
reasonable grounds 10 0116 of the litigante, and, if he thus obtain
more than his share, to condemn him to make pecuniary com-
pensation.’
, §43. Taxatio [signified by the word ‘dumtaxat’] was a limita·
tion to the condemnatio. Besides the kind noticed by Gaius, there
were several othere. If a paterfamilias was sued for the debt of a
