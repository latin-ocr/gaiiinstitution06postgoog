11.§§ 152-173.] DE HEREDUM QUALITATE. ,2⁵³

these limitatione of testamentary power may be considered ae
correlations and compensatione of the patria potestas. An Eng-
lish testator has nnlimited power to dispose of his property, and
natural feeling is supposed to be a sufficient guaranty that none
of his children will be left without suitable provision. Of Roman
testatore J ustinian says rather crudely: Plerumque parentes sine
causa liberos suos vel exheredant vel omittunt, Inst. 2, 18, pr.
‘ Most parents disinherit or pretermit their children without any
cause? In spite of this expression, we may conjecture that parental
caprice was not greater in Rome than in England, but the mon·
strous development of the patria potestas, whereby the person and
fortnnes of the child were entirely at the mercy of the father during
his lifetime, made any instance of testamentary caprice seem more
iniquitouS, more intolerable, in Rome than it would in England.
'l'he restrictione were as follows :—

(1) We have seen that a suns heres must either be instituted
or disinheritcd. This secured him against being simply forgotten.

(2) If he was disinherited without a cause, or received less than
one fourth of his share by descent (quarta legitimae), he could by
impeaching the will as immoral or unnatural (querela inofficiosi
testamenti) have it set aside on the fictitious preusmption of the
testator's insanity. The presumption, at least, was so far fictitious
that it was not allowed to be rebntted by any other proof of his
sanity except proof of the adequacy of the motives for which the

child was disinherited. 'I'he‘querela inofficiosi was a form of petitio ζ

hereditatis, that is, a real action, and fell under the jurisdiction of
the centumviral court. 'l'he amount which must be deviscd to a
snus heres to save a will from avoidance for inofficiositas was pro·
bably fixed by the lex Falcidia, for it is identical with the amount
which that law secures to the child when instituted heir. The
querela inofficiosi could not only be brought by suus heres but by
certain other near relatives, namely, parente, brothers, and sisters,
and by children against their mothers’ will 3 in which cases, it
must be confessed, the alleged motive, compensation for the patria
potestas, is wanting.

(3) Although a suus heres were instituted heir, yet the institu-
tion might be made illusory by the exhaustion of the whole inherit-
ance in legacies, leaving nothing to the heir but the burden of
administration.'1'o meet this, the lex Falcidia provided that when
more than three fourths of an inheritance is absorbed in legacies,
