on the thirtieth day the Praetor no-
minated a judex. This was in pur-
suance of the lex Pinaria, before
which the judex [was named at an
earlier period η. If the subject of
dispute was worth less than a thou·
sand assae, the stake, as before men-
tioned, was only fifty. After the
judex was named, they gave mutual
notice to appear before him on the
next day but one. At the appear-
ance before the judex, before the
case was fully developed, it was
stated in a concise and summary
form, and this summary statement
was called causae collectio [or causae
conjectio}

as proprietor, by the law of the
Quirites, by the title which Ι have
shown. Lo you, thus upon him I
lay my lance,' whereupon he touched
the man with his wand. The ad—
versary then said the same words
and performed the same acts. After
both had claimed dominion, the
praetor said: ‘ Both claimants quit
your hold,’ and both quitted hold.
Then the first claimant said, ad-
dressing the second: ‘ Answer me,
will you state on what title you
found your claim 'l ' and he replied:
‘ I stated my title before 1 touched
him with my lance,' Then the first
claimant said: ‘ Since you claim
him in defiance of law, I challenge
you to stake five hundred asses
upon the issue of a trial,' to which
the other answered, ‘I accept the
challenge.’ Or else they wagered
