not an application of some general command of the legislator, but
is itself a law, and will serve as the governing principle of future
adjudication. If we describe Law as a universal interdict addressed
by the legislator to the community, Interdict may be described as
a particular Law addressed by the magistrate to individuale. This
will appear more plainly when we come to the details of Interdiet
procedure.

Interdicts relate to subjecte in almost all departments of the code.

A. In jus publicum and jus sacrum we find the interdicte re-
lating· to sacred places and public places—public roads or public
rivers. These places are protected by interdicta popularia, inter-
dicts in which any individua] may vindicate as prosecutor the
interests of the public, Dig. 43, 8, 2, 34.

B. In the law of status and the law of domestic relations there
are the interdictum de homine libero exhibendo, Dig. 43, 29, a kind
of Writ of Habeas Corpus: interdicta de liberis exhibendis and de
liberis ducendis, protecting the patria potestas, Dig. 43, 30: a'nd de
libertis exhibendis, assisting the patron.

C. In the code of Property (res familiaris) and (1) in the depart-
ment of res singulae we have the interdicte Utrubi, Uti possidetis,
and Unde vi, relating· to the possession of movables and immovables:
and others, closely allied, similarly related to the subjecte of ser-
vitudes. In controversies between owners of neighbouring land we
have interdictum Demolitorium based on Operis novi nunciatio (an
admonition of the defendant to desist from some architectural in-
novation), an interdict requiring the demolition of the building·
erected in spite of such prohibition on the part of the plaintiff
(nuncians), and before such prohibition was set aside by judicial
authority, Dig. 39, 1: and the interdict Quod vi aut clam, simi-
larly requiring the restitution or undoing· of some innovation in
land (polluting streame, cutting· trees, ploughing up pasture, διο.)
that has been executed either furtively or in face of the prohibition
of some party who is interested and who has jus prohibendi, Dig.
43, 24: and other interdicte de arboribus caedendis and de glan-
de legenda, Dig. 42, 27, 28, enforcing· provisions of the Twelve
Tables.

1 said that interdieta were to be found in almost au depart-
ments of the code. It is observable that no interdicte are employed
under the code of Obligation (choses in action, jus in personam)
except in cases which combine obligation with a real right (jus in
