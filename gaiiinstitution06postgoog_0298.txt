ᾧ 224. A slightly different form of this celebrated ordinance is
given by the Auctor ad Herennium: Paterfamilias uti super familia
pecuniave sua legaverit ita jus estc, 1, 13, 23 5 also Cic. De Invent.

ᾧ 225. 'Phe lex Furia testamentaria, supposed to have been
passed 183 Β. 0., although it imposed on the legatee who took more
than a thousand asses a penalty of four times the amount of the
0110000, which was recoverable by manus injectio pura, 4 ᾗ 23, yet is
instanced by Ulpian as a minus quam perfecta lex, because, though
it imposed a penalty 011 the legatee, it did not invalidate the pro·
hibited bequest. In a minus quam perfecta lex the legislator,
instead of declaring invalid the disposition that 110 wished to dis-
courage, or conferring 011 the person burdened by such disposition
a counter right (exceptio) whereby he might defeat the claim of
the person who sought to enforce such disposition, merely imposed
011 the creditor under such a disposition a penalty if he either
enforced his claim by suit or if he even accepted voluntary pay-
ment from the person who stood in the relation of debtor. Minus
quam perfecta lex est quae vetat- aliquid fleri et si factum sit non
rescindit sed poenam injungit 01 qui contra legem fecit: qualis
est lex Furia testamentaria quae plus quam mille assium legatum
mortisve 001100 prohibet capere praeter exceptas personae, et ad-
versus eum qui plus ceperit quadrupli poenam constituit, Ulpian,
l, 2. So the lex Furia de sponsu, 3 ᾤ 121, which perhaps was
another clause of the cnactment which contained the lex Furia
testamentaria, imposed a penalty on the creditor who exacted more
than a ratable portion of a guaranteed debt from a single sponsor,
4 ᾦ 22. By the lex Falcidia, on the contrary, a lex perfecta which
superseded the lex Furia testamentaria, a legacy was absolutely
null and void (ipso jure) beyond a certain extent and the heres as
debtor could not be forced to pay more than the sum prescribed,
a rule which may be expressed by the maxim, legata ipso jure
minuuntur: and the Epistola Hadriani, 3 ᾤ 121, which similarly
01111010οᾶοᾶ the lex Furia de sponsu, conferred a counter right
called Beneficium divisionis on the fidejussor or surety who was
sued for more than a ratable portion of the debt, enabling him
to defeat the valid claim of the creditor by the exceptio divi-
sionis. Under the lex Furia testamentaria the heres could neither
defend himself by alleging ‘the absolute nullity ‚of the exces-
sive bequest (ipso jure) nor by alleging an opposing right
