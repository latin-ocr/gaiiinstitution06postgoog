time of Augustus the auctoritas of the sena-te began to be regarded
as the essential process in making a law, and the Subsequent

2 rogatio of the Comitia as a mere formality, which was finally

, omitted. Senatusconsults, like laws, were sometimes named after

the consuls who proposed them, and are sometimes even called
leges: thus the measure which Gaius calls Sc. Claudianum, 1 ξ 84,
is subsequently referred to ΒΥ him under the name of lex, 1 ξ 86.
Ulpian says, Non ambigitur senatum jus facere posse, Dig. 1, 3, 9,
‘it is unquestioned that what the senate decrees becomes part of
the civil law.' Of course, these senatusconsults were merely a
disguised form of imperial constitution. 'I'he sovereignty had
passed from both patricians and plebeians to the hands of an
autocrat. A measure was recommended by the emperor in an
oratio or epistola to the senate, and then proposed ΒΥ the consul
who convoked the senate, and voted ΒΥ the senate without oppo-

periods. They may be characterized as legislative, judicial, and
interpretative. .

'Edicts were legislative ordinances issued ΒΥ the emperor in
virtue of the jurisdiction appertaining to him as highest magis-
trate, and were analogous to the edicts of the praetors and ediles.

Decreta were j udicial decisions made ΒΥ the emperor as the
highest appellate tribunal: or in virtue of his magisterial jurisdic-
tion, and analogous to the extraordinaria cognitio of the praetor.

Epistolae or rescripta were answers to inquiries addressed to the
emperor by private parties or by judges. They may be regarded
as interpretations of law ΒΥ the emperor as the most authoritative
juris peritus.

The words of Gaius explaining why constitutions had the force
of law seem to be imperfect, and may be supplemented from
J ustinian: Sed et quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem:
cum lege regia, quae de imperio ejus lata est, populus ei et in
eum omne suum imperium et potestatem concessit, Inst. 1, 2, 6.
‘ Imperial constitutions have the effect of law, because ΒΥ the lex
regia, whereby the emperor is invested with his office, the people
confers on him all its sovereignty and power.' The lex imperii,
