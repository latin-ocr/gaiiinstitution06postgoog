power I have no action. The other
school maintain that while be is in
my power the action is only in

ξ 79. When a filiusfamilias is
surrendered in satisfaction of judg·
ment in a noxal action, the other

power of the father unless he is
three times mancipated. Sabinus

jection are ordered by the praetor
to be sold. An action rescinding
the change of status and deriving its
binding force from the praetor’s
executive supremacy . . .
