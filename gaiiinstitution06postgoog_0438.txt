ξ 141. I tem pretium in numerata
pecunia consistere debet. nam in
ceteris rebus an pretium esse possit,
veluti homo aut toga aut fundus
alterius rei precium osse possit, valde
quaeritur. nostri praeceptores put-
ant etiam in alia re posse consistere
pretium ; unde illud est quod vulgo
putant per permutationem rerum
emptionem et venditionem contrahi,
eamque speeiem emptionis et vendi-
tionis vetustissimam esse 3 argu-
mentoque utuntur Graeco poeta

Homero qui aliqua parte sic ait τ 2

Ἐνθεν ἄρ’
Ἀχαιοί,

'Axio‘ μὲν χαλκῷ, ἄλλοι δ’ αἴθωνι σιδήρῳ,
Ἀλλοι δὲ ῥινοῖς, ἄλλοι δ’ αὐτῇσι βόεσσιν,
ἸἈλλοι δ’ ἀνδραπόδεσσιν.

Diversae scholae auctores dissen-
tiunt, aliudque esse existimant per-
mutationem rerum‚ aliud emptionem
et venditionem: alioquin nosn posse
rem expediri permutatis rebuS‚ quae
videatur res venisse et quae pretii

[111. ξς 139-141.

ξ 141. The price should be in
money, for it is much disputed
whether anything but money, such
as a slave, a robe, a piece of land, can
be treated as price. My school hold
the affirmative, and regard exchange
as a species, and the oldest species,
of purchase and sale3 in support
of which they quote the linos of-
Homer:

‘ Here touched Achaean barks in
quest of wine.

They purchased it with copper and
with steel,

With hides, with horned cattle, and,

with slaves!

The other school maintain the nega·
tive, and distinguish between ex-
change and purchase and sale, be-
cause in exchange we cannot deter-
mine which is the thing sold and
which is the price, and both things
cannot be regarded as both the
thing sold and the price. Caelius
Sabinus says that if Titius offers,
say, land for sale, and I give him a

slave for it, the thing sold is the

que videri et venisse et utramque
land and the price is the slave.

pretii nomine datam esse absurdum
videri. Sed ait Caelius Sabinus, si
rem Titio venalem habente, veluti
fundum, acceperim, et pretii nomine
hominem forte dederim, fundum qui·
dem videri venisse, hominem autem
pretii nomine datum esse, ut fundus
acciperetur.

It is necessary to distinguish clearly between the completion of a
contract of sale and the subsequent transmutation of property;
between the creation of a jus in personam and the creation of a jus
in rem3 between the acquisition of an obligation and the acquisition

of ownership.
¹ The contract is complete as soon as the price is agreed upon, but
· no property passes until the price is paid and possession is de-
livered, or, in the case of a sale on credit, until possession is
delivered. Quod vendidi et tradidi non aliter fit accipientis quam
si, aut pretium nobis solutum sit, aut satis eo nomine sactum, vel
etiam fidem habuerimus emptori sine ulla satisfactione, Dig. 18,
1, 19. ‘ Sale and delivery do not pass property unless the price is
