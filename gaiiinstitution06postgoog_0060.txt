1, 2, 47. ‘ Until Augustae, the public decision of legal questions
was not a right conferred by imperial grant, but any one who
relied on 1116 knowledge advised the clients who chose to consult
him. Nor were juristic opinions always given in a letter closed
and 6661611, but were generally laid before the judge 16 1116 writing
or by the attestation of one of the suitors. Augustus, in order
to increase their weight, enacted that they should be clothed with
his authority, and henceforth this office was songht for as an
imperial favour.' 'Phose jux-ists who had the J us respondendi were
called J uris auctores. Their auctoritas resided, in the first instance,
in their responsa, or the written opinions they gave when consulted
on a single case3 but in the second instance, doubtless, in their
writings, which in fact were mainly a compilation of their responsa,
a fact which has left its traces in the disjointed 6611 16601161661
style which disagreeabl y characterizes Roman juristic literature.
In the course of centuries the accumulation of juristic writings of
coordinate authority was 6 serious embarrassment to the tribunale.
'ro remedy this evil, Aa). 426, Theodosius and Valentinian enacted
what is called the law of 611611066, Cod. Theodosianus, 3, limiting
legal authority to the opinions of five jurists, Gaius, Papinian,
Ulpian, Paulus, Modestinus, and of any other jurists whom these
writers quoted, provided that such quotations should be verifled
by reference to the original writings of those juris auctores. In
case of a divergence of opinion, the authorities were to be counted,
and the majority was to prevail. In case of an equal division of
authorities, the voice of Papinian was to prevail. ’.1.6. 533, J us-
116166 published his Digest or Pandeets, a compilation of extracts
*from the writings of the jurists‚ to which he gives legislative
authority. Every sentence, accordingly, of these passages is called
a lex, and the remainder of their writings is pronounced to be
absolutely void of authority. To prevent the recurrence of the
evil which his codification was intended to remove, and confident
in the lucidity and adequacy of his Digest and Code, J ustinian
prohibits for the future the composition of any juristic treatise
or commentary on the laws. If any one should disregard the
prohibition, the books are 10 be destroyed and the author punished
as guilty of forgery (falsitas), Cod. l, 1⁷, 2, 21.
