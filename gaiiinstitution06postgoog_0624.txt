602 DE ACTIONIBUS. [ιν. §5 115-137.

exception to 'the jurisdiction of the court (exceptio fori incompe-
tentis): the objection to a minor issue being tried, while a con·
nected major issue from which it cannot be separated is undecided
(exceptio praejudicialis): objection to the appointment of this pro·
curator by the plaintiff (exceptio cognitoris, procuratoria).

(b) Examples of exceptione based on the material code are:

In the department of domestic or family law, the exception pro-
tecting maternal rights against paterna13 i. e. protecting the right
of a mother to educate her infant children against her husband who
seeks by the interdict de liberis exhibendis or ducendis to enforce
the prerogatives of patria potestas, Dig. 43, 30, 3, 5: or protecting
marital rights against paternal rights 3 i. e. protecting the right of
the husband to the societ-y of the wife against her father who
endeavours by exercising his patria potestas to break up a united
household, Dig. 43, 30, 1, 5.

In the department of real law the defendant in a vindicatio by
putting forward the exceptio rei venditae et traditae may counter·
poise the plaintiff's quiritary right by objecting his own bonitary
right, Dig. 21, 3, 1, 2: or he may allege as a counteracting right
against the plaintiff's dominion a jus in re, e. g. pignus, Dig. 10,
3, 69, οι· superficies, Dig. 43, 18, 1, 4. In the actio Publiciana
when the purchaser from a non-proprietor endeavours to recover
the thing from the true proprietor‚ the defendant may oppose
quiritary to bonitary right by putting forward the exceptio dominii:
Si ea res possessoris non sit, Dig. 6, 2, 17, said to be the only
exception which in form alleges a right of the defendant, whereas
all other exceptions‚ though they too are all virtually and in effect

allegations of a right, in external form are allegations of a fact.
In the department of obligation the defendant's counteractive

plea may be an allegation of Force or Error or Formless release.
Force and Error, as we have seen, p. 22, do not deprive a disposi-

tion of validity, but produce an independent right of redress.
Although Exceptio is always the allegation of a right of the

· defendant, the right which it alleges, though in other respects of

the same nature as the right of a plaintiff, is not always sufficiently
energetic to form a ground on which an action might be main-
tained. We have an instance of this inferior energy in the obli·
gatio naturalis which is generated by nudum pactum, of which
we read: Igitur nuda pactio obligationem non parit sed parit
exceptionem, Dig. 2, 14, 7, 4.
