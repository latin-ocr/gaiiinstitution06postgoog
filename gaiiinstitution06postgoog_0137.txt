of the father over their person and property is terminated by two
events which did not operate emancipation in Roman law, marriage
and arrival at years of diseretion, that is, attainment of majority by
the eompletion of twenty-one years of age. At these points, under
English law, the empire of the father or other guardian gives place
to the empire of reason3 whereas neither marriage nor majority
released the Roman son or daughter from patria potestas.

ξ 137. A woman subjected to
hand by coemption is released
therefrom by remancipation, and on
subsequent manumission becomes
independent. A wife subject to
marital band can no more com-
pel her husband to release her from
his hand without dissolution of the
marriage than a daughter can com-
pel her father. A daughter, how-
ever, has no means of compelling
her father, even if he is only such
by adoption, whereas a wife by
sending a message of divorce can
compel her husband to release her
from his hand, just as if they had
never been married (i. 6. as if 116
were a mere coemptionator).

ξ 138. As persons in mancipation
have the status of slaves, manumis-
sion by fictitious vindicatiom by
entry on the censor's register, by tes-
tamentary disposition, are the modes
by which they acquire independence.

ξ 139. But to them the lex Aelia
Sentia has no application: no age
of the person manumitting or the
person manumitted is required ; the
manumission is subject to no pro-
viso against fraud on the rights of
patron or creditors, nor even to
the numerical limitation of the lex
Furia Caninia.

in mancipation is not required for*
manumission by entry on the regis-
‘aer of the censor, except when a son
has been mancipated by 6 father
with a condition of remancipatiom
for by such a condition the father
is deemed to have reserved a certain
