began: thus a year of 365 days beginning at any moment of 1 J an.
is completed a moment aster the midnight which separates Dec. 30
from Dec. 31. This computation was employed when a right was
to be acquired 011 the expiration of a certain term.

(3) Or the last day was not counted at all until its actual termi-
nation, so that the year beginning at any hour of 1 J an. is not com-
pleted till the midnight which separatas 31 Dec. from 1 J an. This
mode was employed when a right was to be lost 011 the expiration
of a certain term.

If a right was to be acquired on the expiration of a certain
period, it was acquired as soon as the last day of the period
began ; for instance, if the period was a year, the right was acquired
immediately after midnight of the 364th day. This, applied to
acquisition of ownership by usucapion, Dig. 44, 3, 15, and Dig. 41,
3, 6 ; acquisition of testamentary capacity by attaining to years of
puberty, Dig. 28, 1, 53 acquisition of manumissive capacity, Dig.
40, 1, 1 3 acquisition by a Latin of the franchise by bringing up a
yearling (anniculus) issue of a lawful marriage, Dig. 50, 16, 132.
Anniculus trecentesimo sexagesimo quinto die dicitur, incipiente
plane, non exacto die, qnia annum civiliter non ad momenta tem-
porum sed ad dies numeramus, Dig. 50, 16, 134. ‘A child is said to be
a yearling on its 365th day, at the beginning, not at the close of the
day3 for civil computation of the year does not recognize the minor
subdivision into minutes or hourS, but only reckons by whole days?

When, on the contrary, a right was forfeited or extinguished by
lapse of a certain period, as in the loss of a right of action under a
statute of limitatione, Dig. 44, ’7, 6, the period was not completed
until the last day was ended.

Such is Vangerow's doctrine, ᾧ 196. So deficient, however,
in precision is the Latin language when it attempts to define
periods of time, that Savigny, with the same passages before
him, makes the civil year one day longer, both when a right
is acquired and when a right is extinguished3 that is, he makes
the first of the 365 days which compose the year to be the day
aster the day on which occurs the event that forms the starting
point of the year3 whereas Vangerow includes within the year the
day on which the limiting event occurred. Thus Savigny would
make an annual usucapion beginning 1 Jan. end a moment after the
midnight separating 31 Dec. from the next 1 J an„ and the pre-
scription of a right of action commencing to run from a l J an.
