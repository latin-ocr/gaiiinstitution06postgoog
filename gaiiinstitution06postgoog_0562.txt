integrum restituitur, ut minuatur
condemnatio, sivero minus positum
fuerit quam oportet, hoc solnm con-
sequitur quod posuit ε nam tota
quidem res in iudicium deducitur,
constringitur autem condemnationis
fine, quam iudex egredi non potest.
nec ex ea parte Praetor in integrum
restituit: facilius enim reis Praetor
succurrit quam actoribus. loquimur
autem exceptis minoribns xxv an-
norum3 nam huius aetatis homini-
bus in omnibus rebus lapsis Praetor
succurrit.

§58. Si in demonstratione plus
aut minus positum sit, nihil ,in iu-
dicium deducitur, et ideo res in
integro manet: et hoc est quod
dicitur falsa demonstratione rem
non perimi.

§ 59. Sed sunt qui putant minus
recte comprehendi. nam qui forte
Stichum et Erotem emerit, recte
videtur ita demonstrare : QUOD EGO
DE ΤΕ HOMINEM EROTEM Em, ct si
velit, de Sticho alia formula idem
agat, quia verum est eum qui duos
emerit singulos quoque emisse: id-
que ita maxime Labeoni visum est.
sed si is qui unum emerit (16 duobus
egerit, falsum demonstrat. idem et
in aliis actionibus est, velut com-
modati, depositi.

ᾗ 60. Sed nos aput quosdam
scriptum invenimus, in actione de-
positi et denique in ceteris omnibus
quibus damnatus unusquisque igno-
minia notatur, eum qui plus quam
oporteret demonstraverit litem per·
dere. velut si quis una re deposita
duas res deposuisse demonstraverit,
aut si is cui pugno mala percussa
est in actione iniuriarum esse aliam
partem corporis percussam sibi de-
monstraverit. quod an debeamus
credere verius esse, diligentius re-
quiremus, 66τί6 cum duae sint de-
positi formulae‚ alia in ius concepta,

DE ACTIONIBUS.

[1v. §§ 53—60.

less is laid in the condemnatio than
he is entitled tc, he only obtains
that amount, for his whole right has
been brought before the judex and
is reduced to the amount laid in the
Condemnatio, a limit which the
judex cannot exceed 3 and in this
case the praetor gives no relies, for
he is less ready to relieve the plain-
tiff than the defendant, excepting
always minors, whom he invariably
relieves.

ξ 58. If more or less is laid
in the DemonstratiO, the plaintiff’s
right is not tried and therefore re-
mains intact, and this is the mean-
ing of the saying that a right of
action is not consumed by a false
Demonstration.

ξ 59. Some think that less may
be properly expressed in the De-
monstrati0‚ as a man who bought
both Stichus and Eros may state
in his Demonstrati0‚ ‘ Whereas Ι
bought of you the slave Eros: and
sue for Stichus in another action,

‚because the purchaser of both is the

purchaser of each; and this was
Labeo’s opinion. But if the pur-
chaser of one says he purchased two,
the Demonstratio is false; and the
same applies to actions of Loan for
use and Deposit. ·

ξ 60. Ι have read in some writers
that in actions of Deposit‚ and where-
ever condemnation involves infamy,
a plaintiff has. consumed his right
to sue if his Demonstratio exceeds
the truth (or names one thing for
another), for instance, if he de·
posited one thing and says 116 (16-
posited two, or if he was struck in
the face and his Demonstratio in an
action of assault mentions another
part of the body. Let us examine
this question. There are two for-

mulas of the action of Deposit, 0116
of law, the other of fact, as we said
