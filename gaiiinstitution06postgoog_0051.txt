corresponding institutione of jus gentium were the acquisition of
property ΒΥ Tradition, contract ΒΥ Stipulation without the solemn
term Spondeo, title to intestate succession ΒΥ Cognatio or natural
relationship. Other departments of life were not subject to parallel
institutes of Civil law and Natural law, but the mutual relations of
citizens with citizens as well as of citizens with aliens were exclu-
sively controlled by Gentile law: e.g. the contracts called Con-
sensual, such as buying and selling, letting and hiring, partnership3
and contracte called Real, such as the contract of loan for use or
loan for consumption.

Gentile titles to Property (jus in rem), titles which ultimately
superseded civil titleS, are explained at large in Book ΙΙ.

In respect of Obligation (jus in personam), Gentile law may‘ be
divided into two classes, according to the degree in which it was
recognized by Civil law :—

A. A portion of Gentile law was recognized as a ground of
Action. 'ro this class belong (1) the simple or Formless conti-acts
to which we have alluded, (2) obligations to indemnify grounded
on delict, (3) right quasi ex contractu to recover property when it
has been lost by one side and gained by the other without any
title, Dig. 12, 6, 14, and Dig. 25, 2, 25. Actions founded on this
obligation to restore (condictiones), although it was a naturalis
obligatiO, Dig. 12, 6, 15, were as rigorous (stricti juris) as any in
the Civil code. In these cases the obligatio, though naturalis as
founded in J us gentium, yet, as actionable, was said to be civilis
obligatio, Dig. 19, 5, 5, 1.

The two eminently Civil spheres of the law of obligation were
(1) specialty or Formal contracte, and (2) bilaterally penal suits.
Yet even into these provinces Gentile law forced a partial entrance.
We shall see that aliens could be parties to a Stipulatio or Verbal
contract, though not ΒΥ the civil formulary, Spondeo 3 ξ 93; and
to Transcriptio 3 ξ 133, and Syngrapha 3 ξ 134, certain forms
of Literal contract; and could be made plaintiffs or defendants in
bilaterally penal suits ΒΥ means of the employment of certain
Ficffions, 4 ξ 37. This, however, was rather the extension of
Civil law to aliens than the intrusion of Gentile law into a Civil
province.

B. Other rights and obligations of Gentile law were not ad-
mitted as direct grounds for maintaining an action, yet were other-
wise noticed ΒΥ the institutes of Civil jurisprudence and indirectly
