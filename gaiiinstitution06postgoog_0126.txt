104 DE PERsoms. [1. ξς los-115 b.

year of cohabitation was not completed before midnight of the 31st
of December, and that the wife could satisfy the law by leaving
before midnight on the 28tb. If the vesting of manus had been
regarded as an acquisition of a right by the husband, the year
would have been complete immediately after midnight of December
30, and the wife could not have accomplished a sufficient interrup-
tion of possession (usurpatio) unless she lest her husband’s house
before nightfall on the 27th. If we adopted Savigny's view
of the duration of the year, we, of course, must interpret the
termination of the year at the midnight separating the 31st
December from lst of J anuary, instead of at. the midnight ⁶
separating lst J anuary from 2nd J anuary, as being, on the
contrary, a proof that the vesting of manus by cohabitation was
regarded as an acquisition of power by the husband, not as a loss of
independence by the wife.

ᾧ 114. Fiducia was a declaration of the conditions‚ purposes, and
trusts of a mancipation. Besides its use in coemption, it was
employed, as we shall see presently, in emancipation and adoption,
and was the earliest form of constituting the contracte of deposit
and mortgage, 2, ᾧ 59.

Fiducia must not be identified with nuncupatim Nuncupatio
forms an integral part of Mancipatio, and with it is a title of
civil law, and ground to support an actio stricti juris. Fiducia
never coalesces with Mancipatio, but remains a separate adjnmt,
forming a title of Gentile law, and ground ¹to support a bonae
fidei actio. Herein Mancipatio is contrasted with Tradition and
the dispositione of natural law. Conventions accompanying Tra-
dition unite with it, and form a single consolidat—‚ed disposition3
and the pacts annexed (pacta adjecta) to any contract of natural
law (venditim conductio, mandatum, Suc.) become integral parts
thereof‘, and are enforced by the action brought on the prin-
cipal contract. Stipulatio, as a civil disposition, seems to have
originally resembled Mancipation in this respect: at least it was a
late period of the law when the rule was clearly established that:
Pacta incontinenti facta stipulationi inesse creduntur, D. 12, 1, 40,
i. e. Pacis contemporaneous with a stipulation are deemed to be
portione of the stipulation or to have acquir-ed the effieacy. of stipu-
latione. Savigny ᾧ 268.
