period, persons who were not recognized as heirs by the civil code,
namely cognates, and the wife or husband, were put in possession
in default of civil heirs: and children (liberi) who by emancipation
had lost the character of self-successors, were nevertheless admitted
to pmcn in the first rank just as if they had continued un-
emancipaoed. 'Phe right of provisional possession of course cor-
responded to a presumptive right of definitive ownersbip.

Although a will was propounded, yet if a descendant of the
testator was therein pretermitted (praeteritus), i. e. not expressly
either instituted successor or disinherited, possession was not
granted to the devisees but to the pretermitted descendant (bono-
rum possessio contra tabulas). Contra-tabulas possession was
sometimes equivalent to intestacy, sometimes to partial testacy.
If the praeteritus was suus heres the will was absolutely void:
if the praeteritus was an emancipated son, although he obtained

mummbular possession, he was bound, as we shall see, by some '⁴

of the dispositione of the will; so that his succession was partly
intestato, partly testate.

majority, were subject to perpetual guardianship. In the time of
Gaius, the only effectual guardianship to which they continued
subject appears to have been that of ascendants and patrons. By
the time of J ustinian even this had ceased, for he mentions without

any reservation that the tutelage of women censes on their attaining
the age of 12, Inst. 1,‚22.

the lifetime of the father, no devisee

its original nullity. But, according
