lius sic posse institui postumos nepotes induxit: Si filius meus
vivo me morietur, tunc si quis mihi ex eo nepos sive quae neptis
post mortem meam in decem mensibus proximis, quibus filius
meus moreretur, natus nata erit, heredes sunto, Dig. 28, 2, 29, pr.
‘ Gallus Aquilius introduced the institution of afterborn grand-
children in the following manner: If my son die in my lifetime, κ,
¹s then let any grandson or granddaughter by him who may be born ἶ
i aiter my death within ten months after the death of my son, be my
³* successor.' Such grandchildren are called Postu—*mi* Qiligm.

In respect of the suus heres born after the making of ‚the will
but in the lifetime of the testator, the case which the civil law
left to the operation of the general rule, it might certainly be
sometimes possible to make a new will after his birth, but it might
sometimes be impossible or highly inconvenient‚ and accordingly
the ηΙοειι Ιυιι-ἱ-Βῂνθῦεῇἓ passed A. 1). 10, at the close of the reign of
Augui‘s't‘i‘i'sf in= its ”first chapter permitted such children ⁴ also-jos the
testator, and also grandchildren of the testator born aster their
father's death in the lifetime of their grandfather, to be insti-
tuted or disinherited. Such children and grandchildren were
called Postumi Velleiani primi ᾳΒΗΕΒ In its second chapter it
permitted nthe institution or disinheritance of another class of un-
certain persons, viz. quasi-asterborn children (postumorum loco);

grandchildren, for instance, who were born before the making of
the will but whose acquisition of the character of sui heredes by
, the decease of their father is subsequent to the making of the will.

Such grandchildren are called Postumi Velleiani secundi capitis.

Resides the Postumi Aquiliani, ffie Postumi Velleiani primi
capitis and the Postumi Velleiani secundi capitis, the jurist Salvius
Julianus who systematized the Edict established the validity of
the institution or disinheritance of a fourth class, intermediate
between the Postumi Velleiani of the first and second chapter:

Ξ grandchildren, namely, who like the Velleiani of the first chapter

Ῐ were born after the making of the grandfather’s will, but who

l like those of the second chapter were born before the death of

&their father. Such grandchildren are not sui heredes to their
grandfather at their birth, but only by successim, that is by the
subaequent death of their father, like those of the second chapter,
