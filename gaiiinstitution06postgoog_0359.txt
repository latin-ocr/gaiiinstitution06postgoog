the central station of his fortunes, and the head-quartem of his
dealings and dispositions: Incolae vero . . . domicilium facit. Et
in eo loeo singulos habere domicilium non ambigitur, ubi quis
larem rerumque ac fortunarum suarum summam constituit, unde
rursus non sit discessurus, si nihil avocet, unde quum profectus est,
peregrinari videtur, quo si rediit, peregrinari jam destitit, C. 10, 39,
7. ‘ Home is identical with Domici13 and Domicil is agreed to be
the place where a man has established his household gods and the
head-quartem of his transactione and obligations: the place which
he will not leave except for a special purpose ς absence from which
makes him. seem to be a stranger, and return to which makes him
cease to be a stranger.' Sed de ea re constitutum esse (respondit),
eam domum unicuique nostrum debere existimari, ubi quisque sedes
et ,tabulas haberet suarumque rerum constitutionem fecisset, D. 50,
16, 203. ‘ It is undisputed that a'man's home is the place where
he is settled and has his counting-house (account-books) and the
basis of his operatione (or, centre of gravitation of 1118 fortunes).’

A man was liable to munera of the city which he had chosen for
a domicil as well as of that where he had the rights and duties of
citizenship. Domicil, as well as Orig0, constituted a man ’8 General
forum3 that is, in any action in which a man was defendant, the
plaintiff had the election whether he would sue him at his forum
originis or forum domicilii. A man can only be governed by one
Lex: and if he was citizen in any municipality, 116 was governed
by lex originis3 if he was nowhere citizen, he was governed by lex
domicilii. [Domicilium originiS, a monstrous combination of modern
writers, ought to express the coincidence of Domicil and Fatherland‚
but is intended to express the paternal domicil (domicil of a man's
father)] .

'Phe subversion of the Roman empire in the west abolisbed the
importance of the Municipalities 3 and, with the exception of Swit-
zerland where it still prevails, the doctrine of Origo disappeared
from those countries which are still influenced by Roman juris-
prudence. The doctrine of Domicilium still surviveS, at least as to
Forum and Lex, in Private inter-national law: what related to
Munera shared the fate of the other political institutions of the
empire. Savigny, ᾧῷ 350-359.

We may observe that the reason assigned by Ulpian for the
incapacity of Dediticius to make a will, 1118 want of patria, appears
inadequate: sor, if he had no patria, at least he had domicilium, and
