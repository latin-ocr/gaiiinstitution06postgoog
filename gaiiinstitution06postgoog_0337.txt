title by agnation, and made succession by intestacy entirely de-
pendent on the degrees of cognation or natural relationship.

ᾧ 17. Α fragment of Ulpian contains the provision of the Twelve
Tables: Si agnatus nec escit, gentilis familiam nancitor. ‘ In the
absence of an agnate, the gentile shall have the succession.’ Gaius
probably gave the definition of Gentiles after 1 ᾧ 164, where there
is now an hiatus in the MS. Cicero gives the following account :
Gentiles sunt qui inter se eodem nomine sunt: non est satis; qui
ab ingenuis oriundi sunt: ne id quidem satis est: quorum majorum
nemo servitutem servivit: abest etiam nunc; qui capite non sunt
deminuti: hoc fortasse satis est, Topica, 6. ‘ Gentiles are those
who bear a common name—this is inadequate3 who are born of

free-born parents—this is still insufficient; none of whose ances- ’

tors were slaves—something still is wanting 3 who have never
suffered a loss of status. This perhaps is a complete definition.'
This definition explains why gentility in modern languages implies
pure blood, good extraction, noble genealog-5⁷3 but it leaves the
subject wrapped in obscurity. As many of the plebeians were the
descendants of manumitted slaveS, title by gentility would often
imply the devolution of plebeian successione into the hands of
patriciam, a mode of transmission which would be less and less
tolerated as Rome became more and more republican. Cicer0,
however, mentions a cause founded on title by gentility: Quid, qua
de re inter Marcellos et Claudios patricios centumviri judicarunt?
Cum Marcelli ab liberti filio stirpe, Claudii patricii ejusdem nominis
hereditatem gente ad se redisse dicerent: nonne in ea causa fuit
oratoribus de toto stirpis ac gentilitatis jure dicendum? De Orat.
l, 39. ‘ In the cause between the [plebeian Claudii] Marcelli and
the patrician Claudii before the centumviral court, wherein the
plebeian Claudii claimed the succession to a freedman’s son by title
of tace, the patrician Claudii by title of gentility, had not the
advocat-es to discuss the whole law of title by race and title by
gentility Τ

Of the technical meaning of ‘ stirps' we have no information‚ but
assuming stirps to be identical with cognati0‚ we may conjecture
- that the question litigated was this: supposing a patron died with-
·out any lineal descendants, and without any agnates: in the suc-
cession to the estate of his freedman’s son was priority to be given
to the gens of the patron, or to the persons entitled under the
clause in the edict called (see ξ 76, commentary) unde cognati
