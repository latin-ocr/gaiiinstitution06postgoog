manumissoris P It seems that by a rule of which we have no other
notice, the succession to a freedman’s son might ascend to the
patron or his relatives (agnates, gentileS, cognates); and that the
patrician Claudii were the gentiles of the patron, the plebeian
Claudii were his cognates, but not his gentiles.

of the rights of gentiles in the successions of libertini we have

ξ 21. Item agnati capite diminuti
