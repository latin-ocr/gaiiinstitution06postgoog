of the >elementa of a Roman citizenship. J us quiritium, right qui-

, · ritary, sometimes, indeed, denotes all the elementa of civitas

Romana, Roman citizenship: see 3 ᾗ 72. Beneficio principali
Latinus civitatem Romanam accipit si ab imperatore jus quiritium
impetraverit, Ulpian 3, 2. But the only element of citizenship
required for quiritary dominion was commercium, and as we have
seen that the Latinus possessed commercium without connubium,
the Latinus was capable of quiritury dominion. 'Phe alien (pere-
grinus) on the contrary was incapable: yet he had an equivalent
real right, called by Gaius dominion, ᾧ 40, which he acquired by
titles of natural law (jus gentium), e. g. tradition, occupation,
accession, praescriptio, δια, and could maintain by a real action
in the court of the praetor peregrinus or praeses provinciae.

(2.) Provincial land was not capable of quiritary dominion.
Originally, indeed, private dominion appears to have been confined
to movables3 and immovables, at least lands, were only subject to
the other kind of dominion, public dominion or eommunism. Pri-
vate dominion, however, first invaded a portion of the land, to which
it was confined within the historic period, and finally superseded
public dominion over all the ancient Roman territory; and ager
publicus, as opposed to ager privatuS, ceased to exist on Italian soil.
But in the provinces subsequently conquered, land continued to the
end subject exclusively to public dominion3 and thus the essential
feature of feudal tenure, the exclusive vesting of absolute or ulti-
mate dominion over land in the sovereign, a principle commonly
supposed to have been first introduced into Europe by the invading
German bordes, had already existed in full force over by far the
greater portion of the Roman world. It is true that the provinces
were divided into so-called ager publicus and ager privatus3 but
ager privatuS, as well as ager publicus, was subject to a vectigal,
and the tenant of the one and lessee of the other were equally
devoid of absolute ownership. An estate in ager privatus was
acquirable by titles of natural law (jus gentium) and recoverable by
real action (vindicatio), and was sometimes called dominion3 but

was theoretically only possessio or ususfructus, ᾧ 7.

’ (3.) Bonitary dominion was distinct both from alien dominion
and from dominion over provincial land: it may be defined as the
property of a Roman citizen in a subject capable of quiritary pro—
perty, acquired by a title not known to the civil law, but intro-
duced by the praetor, and protected by his imperium or supreme
