the date of condemnatio: In hac actione sicut in ceteris bonae fidei
judiciis . . . rei judicandae tempus, quanti res sit, observatur, quam-
vis in stricti juris judiciis litis contestatae tempus spectetur,
Dig. 13, 6, 3, 2. This is so uncontroverted that in another passage
which fixes the moment of condemnatio as the moment of aestimatio
in a stricti juris action, Dig. 13, 3, 3, we may have little scruple in
assuming that condemnatio is a corrupt reading for contestatio.
Both in stricti juris and bonae fidei actions if a day was fixed for
the performance of a contract, this day was the date of aestimatio:
and if a debtor was guilty of Mora, the creditor had his election
between Lis contestata and Res judicata respectively and the date of
Mora. In an action on Delict the date of Valuation was none of
these but the date of the Delict, i. e. the date of the inception of
the obligation. Savigny System‚ ξ 275.

(9) Another difference related to J uramentum in litem, i. e. the
plaintiff's sworn declaration of the value of the thing in dispute.
When a defendant contumaciously disobeys a judge’s order in a certain
class of bona fide actions where judgment is preceded by an order
(arbitrium) of the judex, namely actiones Arbitrariae, including Real
actions and Personal actions brought to obtain Restitutio or Exhi-
bitio 3 or when ΒΥ dolus or culpa lata the defendant has disabled ·
himself from obeying the judge's order3 then the oath of the
plaintiff as to the value of the subject of litigation fixes theamount
of damages (aestimatio) in which the defendant will be condemned.
Examples of actions brought to recover Restitutio are the actions
Depositi‚ Commodati, Locati, Dotis, Tutelae, Doli‚ MetuS, and the
interdict Unde vi. In bonae fidei actions brought to obtain Traditio,
e. g. in Emptio Venditio, such juramentum in litem was inadmis-
sible. In condictions or actions stricti juris it was never admissible3
except that when the subject of litigation had ceased to exist ΒΥ the
culpa of the defendant, e. g. in the aetio legis Aquiliae, and liti—s
aestimatio would otherwise be impossible to the judex, he might
use the plaintiff s oath as a subsidiary evidence for ascertaining·
what was the selling value of the thing that had been destroyed or
what therein was the plaintiffs exceptional interest.

(h) If performance of a contract was due at a certain place, a
bonae fidei aetion could be brought to recover damages for non-per·
formance at any other forum as well as at the forum of the specified
place, whereas a plaintiff who brought an action stricti juris at any
other forum than the forum of the place where the contract was to
