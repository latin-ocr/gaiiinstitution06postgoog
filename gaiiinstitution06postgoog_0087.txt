may be considered under two heads, (l) as regarding the person of
the son, (2) as regarding proprietary rights acquirable by the son.
1. Over the person of the child the father had originally a power
of life and death. Patribus jus vitae in liberos necisque potestas
olim erat permissa, cod. 8, 47, 10. So the lex Pompeia de parri-
cidiis, enumerating the persons who could be guilty of parricide, or
the murder of a blood relation, omits the father, Dig. 48, 9. Com-
pam also the formula of Adrogatio, ᾧ 98, commentary. But in
later times this power was withdrawn. Hadrian condemned to
deportation a father who in the hunting-field killed his son who
had committed adultery with his stepmother, Dig. 48, 9, 5. Con-
stantine, ΛΦ. 319, included killing by a father under the crime of
parricide, Cod. 9, 17. Fathers retained the power of moderate
chastisement, but severe punishment could only be inflicted by the
magistrate, cod. 8, 47, 3. Si atrocitas facti jus domesticae emen-
dationis excedat, placet enormis delicti reos dedi judicium notioni,
Cod. 9, 15. Trajan compelled a father to emancipato a son whom '
he treated with inhumansty, Dig. 37, 12, 5. It was originally at
the option of the parent whether he would rear an infant or expose
it to perish‚ but in later times exposition was unlawful. Unusquis-
que sobolem suam nutriat: quod si exponendam putaverit, animad-
versioni quae constituta est subjacebit, Valentinian, Valens, and
Gratian, Aa). 374, cod. 8, 52, 2. ‘Every parent must rear his
offspring, and exposition will be punished according to law.'
Originally also parents had the power of selling (mancipandi)
their children into bondage‚ thus producing a capitis minuti0‚ or
degradation of status. In fact, the patriarche of the Roman racc
were slave-dealem who, like some savage tribes in Africa and else-
where, trafficked in the bodies of their own children. We must note,
however, that the bondage into which a Roman father sold his
children was, at least at the time at which this institution is known
to us, a limited degree of subjection: the mancipation could only
be made to another Roman citizen, and the bondsman continued to
be liber and civis. But this power also was withdrawn in more
civilized times. A law of Diocletian and Maximian declares the
sale, donation, pledging of children to be unlawful, Cod. 4, 43, 1.
A rescript of one of the Antonines commences in the following
terms: Rem illicitam et inhonestam admisisse te confiteris, quia
proponis filios ingenuos a te venundatos, cod. ’7, 16, 1: ‘ You are
guilty, by your own admissim, of an unlawful and disgracefiss act,
