ξ 62. Item si alter ex iis patronis
suam partem in hereditatem civis
Romani liberti spernat, vel* ante
moriatur quam cernat, tota hereditas
ad alterum pertinet: bona autem
Latini pro parte decedentis patroni
caduca fiunt et ad populum per·
tinent.

ξ 63. Postea Lupo et Largo Con·
sulibus senatus censuit, ut bona
Latinorum primum ad eum perti-
nerent qui eos liberasset3 deinde ad
liberos eorum non nominatim ex-
heredatos, uti quisque proximus
esset 3 tunc antiquo iure ad heredes
eorum qui liberassent pertinerent.

ξ 64. Quo senatusconsulto quidam
id actum esse putant, ut in bonis
Latinorum eodem iure utamur, quo
utimur in hereditate civium Roma-
norum libertinorum 3 idemque maxi·
me Pegaso placuit. quae sententia
aperte falsa est. nam civis Romani
liberti hereditas numquam ad ex-
traneos patroni heredes pertinet .·
bona autem Latinorum etiam hoc
ipso senatusconsulto non obstantibus
liberis manumissoris etiam ad ex-
traneos heredes pertinent. item in
hereditate civis Romani liberti libe-
ris manumissoris nulla exheredatio
nocet: in bonis Latinorum autem
nocere nominatim factam exhere-
dationem ipso senatusconsulto sig·
nificatur. Verius est ergo hoc
solum eo senatusconsulto actum
esse, ut manumissoris liberi qui
nominatim exheredati non sint prae-
ferantur extraneis heredibus.

DE RERUM UNIVERSITATIBUS. [111. ἐξ 55-76.

§ 62. If one patron renounce his
part in the inheritance of a freed-
man who had. the plenary franchise,
or die before acceptance, the whole
inheritance belongs to the other-5
but the goods of a Latinus Junianns
that would have descended to a de·
eeased patron are vacant and es·
cheated to the state.

ξ 63. At a later period, when
Lupus and Largus were consule, the
senate decreed that the goods of a
Latinus Junianus should belong in
the first place to the manumitter,
in the next to such issue of the pa-
tron as are not individually disin·
herited in the order of their proxi·
mity, and, in default of these, should
belong by the ancient rule of devo-
lution to the external heir of the
manumitter.

§64. The effect of this senatus-
consult is, according to some autho-
rities, that the goods of a Latinus
J unianus are acquired by the same
title as the succession of a freedman
who has enjoyed the full franchise,
and this was the doctrine of Pega-
sus: but this opinion is clearly
erroneous, for a freedman who has
the full franchise never transmits
his succession to an external heir
of his patron3 whereas the
of a Latinus J anianus, by the ex-
press terms of the senatusconsult,
in default of children of the manu-
mitter devolve on his external heir.
Again‚ in the succession of a freed·
man who had the full franchise, the
children of the manumitter- are not
barred by any form of disinherit·
ance} whereas, in respect of the
goods of a Latinus Junianus, they
are barred by individual disinherit-
auce by the express terms of the
senatusconsult. The only true
effect, then, of the senatusconsult
is, that the manumitter's children
in the absence of individual disin-
heritance take precedence of exter-
nal heirs.
