588 DE ACTIONIBUS. [ιν. ξς 110-1 13.

annus utilis, though nominally a year, might really be a much
longer period. Where a right of action lasted beyond a year, every
day was counted (tempus continuum)‚2 ᾗ 1Ζ3. From the inde-

. finite duration of annus utilis it is clear that Tribonian's suggestion,

Inst. 4, 12, pr„ of a connection between the annus of prescription
and the annus of the praetorship is purely fanciful.

ᾗ 112. The transmission of an action to the successors of the
parties is either active transmission, i. e. transmission to the suc-
cessor of the plaintiff, 01· passive transmission, i. e. transmission to
the successor of the defendant.

- The general rule relating to transmission is, that all actions are
transmissus both actively, that-‘ffir‘ffthe heire of the Phintia,
and passively, that is, to the heirs of the defendant.

The exceptione are that (1) as to active transmission Vindiqtive
actions (of which the type is 30110 injuriarum), i. e. actions brought
to avenge wrong to the feelings rather than to repair wrong to the
property, are not transmitted to the heirs of the plaintiff3 and
that (2) as to passive transmission, 1101131 30110113, whether bila-
terally or unilaterally penal (the latter sometimes called rei per-
secutoriae ex delicto) are onlym transmitted 3831331 1110 heirs of the
defendant 30 far as the inheritance 1133 been 01111011οᾱ by his
wrong.

Condictio furtiva lies against 1110 heres of the defendant for the
whole amount (13 solidum): because, although 11113 action 13 occa-
sioned by delict, it 1s 1101 deemed to be delictual 01- penal, but purely

restorative (rei persecutoria).
Penal actions, bilateral and unilateral, when once brought, that

13, when they have once reached the 3 <re of litis contestatio,
become capable of both active and passive transmission: Poenales
autem 30110303, 31 ab ipsis principalibus personis fuerint contestatae,
01 heredibus dantur et contra heredes transeunt, Inst. 4, 12, l.
Under J ustinian‚ when the Adstipulator, Sponsor, and Fidepro-
missor had disappeared, all actions founded 011 contrad: were
passively transmissible in solidum against the heire of the de-
fendant3 and it was apparently a mere inadvertence of ΤΙ-1110111311
10 repeat, Inst. 4, 12, l, the words of Gaiae, ᾗ 113, which con-
template the possibility that an action founded on contr-act should

be incapable of passive transmission.
English law is more favourable than Roman law to the plaintiff

in actions ex delicto in respect of the ,passive transmissioni of the
remedy.
