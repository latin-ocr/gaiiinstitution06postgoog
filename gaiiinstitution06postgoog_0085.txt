ι. ἐξ 48-54.] DE POTESrATE DOMINIOA. 63

Petronia of uncertain date required a slave-owner to obtain the
permission of a magistrate before exposing a slave to be torn to
pisces by wild beasts, and only allowed such permisfion to be
granted for some offence committed by the slave, Dig. 48, 8, 11, 2.
Claudius prohibioed killing slaves who fell siclt, and enacted that
the exposure of a slave to perish in his sickness should operate as
a manumission, conferring Latinitas, Sueten. Claud. 25, cod. 7. 6. 3.
Hadrian deprived proprietors of the power of putting slaves to
death without a judicial sentence, Spartian, Had. 18. Antoninus
Pius declared a proprietor who killed a slave to be guilty of murder,
and subject to the penalty of the lex Cornelia de sicariis. We read
- in Justinian's Digest: Qui hominem occiderit punitur non habita
differentia cujus conditionis homiuem interemit, Dig. 48, 8, 12.
‘ Homicide is punished without regard to the status of the person
killed? The punishment was generally capital. Legis Corneliae
de sicariis et veneficis poena insulae deportatio est et omnium bo·
norum ademptio. Sed solent hodie capite puniri nisi honestiore
loco positi fuerint quam ut poenam legis sustineant : humiliores enim
solent vel bestiis subici, altiores vero deportantur in insulam, Dig.
48, 8, 3, 5. ‘The law of Cornelius Sylla touching· assassins and
poisoners, punishes with transportation to an island and forfeiture of
all property. But at present the punishment is usually capital,
unless the criminal is of exalted station 3 humbler criminals are
thrown to wild beasts, only criminals of higher rank are transportedss
Hadrian prohibited the castration of a slave, consenting or not con-
senting, under penalty of death, Dig. 48, 8, 4, 2. Antoninus Pius also
protected slaves against cruelty and personal violation, Dig. 1, 6, 2.
The Digaet, 1, 6, 1, quoting Gaius, 1 ᾧ 53, after sine causa, inter-
polates‚ legibus cognita, thus placing slaves under the protection of
the law, and almost recognizing in slaves some of the pri merdial
rights of humanity, except that, as already observed, obligation
does not necessarily imply a correlative right. Roman law to the
end, unlike other legislatione which have recognized forms of
slavery, refused to admit any rights in the slave. Florentinus,
however, not long after the time of Gaius, admitted that slavery
was a violation of the law of nature. Servitus est constitutio juris
gentium qua quis dominio alieno contra naturam subicitur, Dig. 1,
5, 4. ‘ Slavery is an institution of Gentile law, making one man
the property of another, in contravention of Natural law.’ Ulpian
says the same: Quod attinet adjus civile, servi pro nullis habentur,
