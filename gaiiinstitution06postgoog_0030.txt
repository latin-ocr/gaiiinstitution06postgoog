8 PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS.

aggrieved party to recur to the public judicature instead of redress-
ing his own grievance‚ and, to use a common expression, taking
the law into bis own hands—an urgently pressing motive in the
infant beginnings of society. Sometimes the end of the lawgiver
is the prevention of the prohibited act by terrorism, by the menace
of the sanction and the execution of the menace. Sometimes the
sanction is retributive or vindictive, the expression of the conscience
or moral sentiments of the society. In humane legislations a col-
latera] end of the sanction is often the reformation of the offender:
this motive is confined to sanctiens of the criminal code.

Το 6 division of Sanctions corresponds an important division
of jurisprudence. Some Sanctions may be enforced or remitted
at the discretiori of a private party, others are enforced at the
discretion of the Sovereign or state, and by the Sovereign or state
alone 6611 the liability of the wrongdoer be remitted. This founds
the division of the code or statute-book into the civil code and the
Crimina] code.

But even the Civil code presents, more strongly marked in Roman
law than in modern systems‚ a similar division of Sanctions. The
principal end or object of some SanctionS, as above stated, is the
redress of injury in the past, compensation or indemnity to the
injured person for his violated primary right3 the end of others
is the prevention of injury in the future, terrorism, or the deterrence
of future wrongdoers by exemplary punishment of a past offender.
On this division of civil sanctiens is based the division of civil
suits into Rei persecutio and Poenae persecutio, a suit to recover
property, and a suit to recover a penalty. A judgment may be
bilaterally penal, that is, may both impoverish the defendant and
ent-ich the plaintiff 3 or it may be unilaterally penal, that is, may
impoverish the defendant without enriching the plaintiff, 6. g. in
a suit for indemnification, when the defendant 'has not gained in
proportion to the loss 116 has inflicted on the plaintiff. A suit
which is Rei persecutio may be unilaterally penal. Bilaterally
penal suits, though common in. Roman law, are unfrequent in
modern legislatione.

'I'he sanction of a right or obligation, whether primary or
secondary, is 6 motive addressed to the will of the person who
owes the obligation, and is the prevision or anticipation of an
intending wrongdoer, that his unlawful gain will be extorted from
him, and, commonly, an additional evil, loss, or pain will be in-
