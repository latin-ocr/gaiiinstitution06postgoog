590 DE ACTIONTBUS. [ιν. §5 115-137.

would have been unjust to the defendant, as was admitted by all
jurists in the case of personal actions ex fide bona.

In personal actions stricti juris it was at first held that what
would have been an adequate ground for the extinction of the
plaintiff's claim if it had happened before litis contestatio, e. g. the
purely casual destruction of the subject of litigation, was ineffectual
to save the defendant from condemnation if it happened after litis
contestatio. Finally, however, the doctrine prevailed that, in the
absence of Mora, such an event was effectual for the absolution of
the defendant, even when it occurred after litis contestatio. See
p. 449.

So in real actions, the purely casual destruction of an object in
the hands of a bona fide possessor, even when it, happened aster
joinder in issue, produced the absolution of the defendant, on the
ground that impossibilium non est obligatio. It is to be observed‚
however, that the grounds effectual for the absolution of the de-
fendant in a real action are limited to thooe which destroy the
Obligation engendered by litis contestatio. 'Phe defendant, that is
to say³ is subject to condemnation in spite of usucapion of property
completed after litis contestatio, in spite of extinction of servitude
by non-usus completed after· the same date, in spite similarly of
casual destruction of the subject in the hands of mala fide possessor
or after mora, and in spite of destruction by the culpa of bona fide
possessor.

Subject to this limitation, the rule was universal: omnia judicia
esse absolutoria: i. e. all classes of action, real as well as personal,
, stricti juris as well as bona fide, whatever the original right of the
plaintiff, may terminate by a judgment in favour of the defendant
in consequence of some event (casual destruction of the subject,
voluntary restitution by the defendant, Sto.) subsequent to litis eon-
testatio· Vangerow,§ 160. Compare what has been stated respecting
actiones Arbitrariae. p. 534.
