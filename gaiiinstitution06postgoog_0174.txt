position in such cases of the highest Roman minister of justice
resembles that of the English chancellor when a suitor is unable to

· obtain redress by the rules and forms of the courts of common law,

· The function of overruling the ordinary course of law where it
collided with equity was only confided to the highest judicial
authority, and even in his hands was governed‚ at all events
in later times, by precise rules of positive law. Five grounds or

titles (justae causae) to extraordinary relief '(extraordinarium auxi-
lium) were recognized and enumerated in the edict, Dig. 4, 1 ι
intimidation (metus), fraud (dolus malus), absence, error, minority
(aetatis infirmitas). Tw0, however, of these titles, fraud and intimi-
dation, had additional remedies in the ordinary course of procedure
(ordo judiciorum), where they were recognized as grounds of excep-
tion and personal action. First a praetor called Cassius introduced
the exceptio doli, D. 44, 4, 4, 33. Then a praetor called Octavius
introduced the actio and exceptio metus mentioned by Cicero,
Verr. 2, 3, 65, where the actio metus is called Formula Octaviana.
Lastly Aquilius, colleague of Cicero, introduced the actio doli, Cic.
de Natura Deorum 3, 30.

The chronological order of the remedy by Action and the
remedy by Restitution is disputed. Savigny holds that the
remedy by Restitution was older than the remedy by Action,
ᾧ 112, ᾧ 191, ᾧ 199 3 while Vangerow holds that the remedy by
Action was older than the remedy by Restitution, ᾧ 185. The
latter opinion seems more consistent with the statement of Cicer0‚
De off. 3, 14.

There are three conditione of Restitution: (Ι) The first condi-
tion is a Laesion by the operation of civil law, i. e. a disadvan-
tageous change in civil rights or obligations brought about by
some omission or disposition of the person who claims relief. This
disadvantage may either consist in positive loss of acquired property,
or in missing a gain which would not have involved, on the part of
another, a positive loss of acquired property. An instance of such
a laesion would be the loss of property by omitting to interrupt
a usucapi0, or by omitting to claim a succession (aditio, agnitio),
or by entering into a foolish bargain.

(2) A second condition is some special or abnormal position of
the person who claims relief when such special circumstance is
the cause of the loss which he has suffered. Thus a minor may
be relieved against an injudicious bargain, but not against the
