146 DE PERsoNIS. [1. §§ 194-196,

tentiae Receptae is found in the code of Alaric 2, king of the Visi-
goths3 and it is to this book that we refer when we simply cite
the authority of Paulus.

A disciple of Ulpian's was Herennius Modestinus, of whom 345
extracts are contained in the Digest. After Modestinus the lustre
of Roman jurisprudence began to decline.

In what did the relation of disciple and teacher (praeceptor)
consist? Principally in this, that a jurist of eminence allowed
youths who aspired to a knowledge of the law to attend in his
chambers and hear the advice which he gave to his cliente. J us
civile docere semper pulchrum fuit, hominumque clarissimorum
discipulis floruerunt domus, Cic. Orator. 41. ‘ To instruct in law
was always honorable, and eminent jurists have ever had crowds of
disciples to grace their chambers.' Cicero himself had been intro-
duced in his youth to Qu. Mucius the augur, and learnt law in his
auditory, Laelius, 1. Three terms are used to indicate three stages
of legal education: instituere, audire, instruere: Servius plurimum
eos de quibus locuti sumus audivit, institutus a Balbo Lucilio,
instructus autem maxime a Gallo Aquilio, Dig. 1, 2, 43. ‘ Servius
was long· an auditor of all these jurists: his education was com-
menced by Lucilius, and completed by Aquilius.' Instituere is to
initiate in the elements of law, to lay the foundations of juridical
knowledge. After completing this stage, the student was allowed
to attend in the auditorium of a jurist and hear the oracles he
delivered on consultation. Instruere denoted a closer intimacy and
longer communication, and gave the learner the name of the

·- --. praeceptor's studiosus. The first two processes seem contrasted

in the following· passage of Cicero: Qu. Scaevola quanquam nemini
se ad docendum dabat, tamen consulentibus respondendo studiosos
audiendi docebat, Brutus, 89. ‘ Scaevola gave no lessons in juris-
prudence, but his answers to clients were instructive to his audi-
tors.' Ulpian calls Modestinus, studiosus meus, Dig. 47, 2, 52, 20.
That studiosus was not a mere student appears from many passages:
Divus Antoninus Pius rescripsit: juris studiosos, qui salaria petant,
haec exigere posse, Dig. 50, 13, 4. ‘ The Emperor Pius ruled that
barristers (apprentices) can recover their sees (by the praetor’s cog-
nitio extraordinaria).' Deinde instituit ut ingratorum in principem
testamenta ad fiscum pertinerent, ac ne impune esset studiosis juris,
qui scripsissent vel dictassent ea, Suetonius, Nero, 32. ‘ Nero
enacted that the successione of persons ungrateful to the emperor
