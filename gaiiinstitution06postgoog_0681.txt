Tm: following observatione are supplementary to the statements,
pp. 360 and 413, on the nature of Pomm, contracts.'

'Phe contracts which in this treatise have been designated as
nonum, are sometimes from a different point of view called Ansmcr,
and an examination of the meaning of this term may throw light
on the function for which Formal contracts were invented by juris-
prudence and which this term expressae. 'Phe explanation of the
term turns on two conceptions: the Cause of an obligation (cansa

οξῐίςὲἑίοηίε) and the Form of a disposition: the cause alone needs
e nci tion.

A unilateral contract, consisting merely of a promise ΒΥ one
party and an acceptanoe by another, is the result of a decomposition
of an actual transaction of commerce and life: actual transactione
are always (to set aside for the present the case of Donation) bila-
teral. The unilateral convention conferring a benefit on A and
imposing a burden on B is always accompanied by another uni-
lateral disposition burdensome to A and beneficial to Β. The two
unilateral dispositione are reciprocally cause and effect: when one
is regarded as the causal factor,· the other must be regarded (if we

may coin a term) as the sequent or dependent faetor of the compo-
site or bilateral transaction.

Thus Mutuum, if we take one factor, is the promise to paya sum
which the promieor kae received from che promisee .- if we take the
other factor, it is the alienation of property to a person who promisee
to reconvey ite equivalent to the alienor. Depositum and Commo-
datum, if we take one factor, are promises to restore Detention
which kas been received from · the promisee .- if we take the other
factor, they are a delivery ΒΥ a depositor or lender of Detention
which the depositam or horrower promises to redeliver. In Pignus there
is a similar delivery and promise to redeliver Possession. Societas
is a promise ΒΥ a partner to contribute towards the attainment cf
a‘common end towards which the otker partncr promisee a like contribu-
