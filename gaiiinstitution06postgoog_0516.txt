still unsatisfied. He was liable to be condemned to pay twice the
amount of the judgment debt‚ and was required to give security
judicatum solvi. This security was the modern representative of
the interposition of a Vindex in the old proceeding of manus
injectio, In manus injectio pro judicato it seems the Vindex who
lost the suit was condemned, as a penalty for his Tortious inter·
fereuce, to pay a sum equal to the original judgment debt 3 in other
wordS‚ to discharge the debtor he had to pay twice the amount of
the debt. In manus injectio pura the defendant was his own Vindex,
and, if he lost, was condemned in double the debt.

The actio depensi [see above, 3 ᾧ 127] was introduced by a lex
Publilia of uncertain date, and as it was only given to the sponsor,
would become obsolete when the sponsor was superseded by the
fidejussor.

J ustinian confined the action of the legatee against the heres for
twice the value of the legacy to the case of bequests to churches
and religious institutionS. Inst. 3, 27, 7.

legum verbis accommodatae erant,

This requires an examination of
the older system.

§ 11. These proceedingsarecalled
statute-process, either because they
were appointed by statute before
the edict of the praetor, the seur-oe
of many new actions, began to be
publislied‚ or because they followed
the letter of a statute and in form
were as immutable as law. ” Thus,
a man who sued another for.cutting
