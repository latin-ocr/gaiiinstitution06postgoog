sovereigns is war or public feud. In the controversies of indi-
viduals the system of private war was abolished in this country
ΒΥ the proclamation of ‘ the king's peace,' renewed at every coro-
nation—the symbol of the consolidation of central authority. For
the controversies of peoples no such abrogation of warlike process
seems possible.

J us in the expression jus belli appears to signify not right or
law but sanction, or executive· power, or means of compulsion. That
this was one of the many meanings of the word appears from Ovid,
who uses the following terms to express a want of sels-control:
Nam desunt vires ad me mihi jusque regendum. Amor, 2, 4.

The necessity of employing any consecrated terms in a stipulation
was abrogated ΒΥ a constitution of Le0, dated the calends of
J anuary, A. D. 469. Omnes stipulationes, etiamsi non solennibus
vel directis sed quibuscunque verbis consensu contrahentium com-
positae sunt [vel], legibus cognitae suum habeant firmitatem, Cod.
8, 38, 10. ‘ Stipulations, though not in consecrated formulas or
direct terms, in whatever words the agreement of the parties is
expressed‚ if otherwise legal, shall have binding force.'

It appears from the epitome of Gaius, contai ned in the laws of
the Visigoths (Breviarium Alarici), that Gaius proceeded to men-
tion two modes of verbal obligation without previous interrogation,
the dotis dictio, and the jurata promissio liberti. Dotis dictio was
the declaration of a wife, or her father, or her debtor, settling a
dotal estate, movable or immovable, on the husband. J urata pro-
missio liberti was the sworn promise of a freedman, immediately after
his manumission, to render certain services (operae) to his patron.
It was usual to bind the conscience of the slave ΒΥ a similar promise
before manumission3 but such a promise had no legal operation.
