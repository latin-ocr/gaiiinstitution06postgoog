624 DE ACTIONIBUS. [xv. ξς 138-170.

within the limits of Ordo judiciorum. Here we find on the one
hand the class of actiones legitimae, actions of civil law, including
under one of the wider acceptatione of civil law actiones ex bona
fide; and on the other the class of actiones praetoriae, that is, ac-
tiones fictitiae and actions with a formula in factum concepta. In
the latter class the praetor, except so far as he abstained with a
demure deference from inserting in the formula the sacred term
Oportere, certainly exercised the attributione of a legislator. A
similar, though not identical division, as already has been men-
tioned, p. 573, was that into judicia legitima and judicia imperio
continentia3 a division that, speaking roughly, corresponded to the
functions of the praetor in imperial Rome and his functione in the
subject provinces· This last division, though important in its time,
was more purely historic and accidental than the preceding: it has
left a less permanent impress on Roman law, and its traces are
nearly effaced from the compilation of J ustinian.

4. Interdict procedure, as opposed to the regular mode of liti· ·
gation, is defined by Gaius by the characteristic feature that the .

magistrate principaliter auctoritatem suam interponit. This feature,
as we have now seen, was not peculiar to Interdicts: but if ν we sup-
pose that Interdicts were coeval with Statutc-process and formed
a matter of Cognitio extraordinaria3 and that, further, the other
subjecte of cognitio extraordinaria were then imperfectly developed;
at such , a period Interdicts would form the most signal manifestation
of magisterial auctoritas: and it is perhaps to a jurist of this period
that the definition we have quoted is due. So large a power of the
magistrate must however have seemed, even at Rome, inconsistent
with republican liberty: and in Interdict procedure, as we know it,
obedience to the praetor’s decree is not enforced by the praetor

„¹32 himself but by a judex, and by legal proceedings in the ordinary

form: either, that is, by an actio stricti jurisor by an actio ex bona

αῖ 2 fide (formula arbitraria, ᾧ 141). Accordingly in the last period we

find Interdict procedure opposed to Cognitio extraordinaria and
ranked under the contraedistinguished class of Jus ordinarium or
Ordo judiciorum : e. g. Ceterum cessat interdictum et succedere
poterit notio praetoris (i. e. cognitio extraordinaria) ut apud eum
disceptetur utrum quis in potestate sit an non sit, Dig. 43, 30, 3, 3.
Thus the Interdict became rather a matter of jurisdictio than of im-
perium. However it still remained true that in issuing an Inter-dict
the praetor had spoken with the voice of a sovereign. This precept is
