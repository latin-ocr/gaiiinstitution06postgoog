being merely the right to a moiety in the improbable contingency
of the freedwoman devising her estate away from her children.

Against the estate of liberta mother of four children who dies
intestate filia patroni has the Papian rights of the patronus in the
same case (assuming, what is not certain, that the Papian rights
of patronus were the same whether the freedwoman died testate or
intestate)‚ i.e. a right to the share of a child. In this solitary
case the Papian rights of filia patroni would be measured not by the
edictal but by the Papian rights of patronus.

Patrona mother of three children had against the estate of libertus
the Papian rights of patronus 3 patrona mother of two children had
the same rights as filia patroni, i.e. the edictal rights of patronus.

Against the estate of liberta who dies testate patrona mother of
(two ?) children has the same rights as filia patroni, i.e. the edictal
'rights of patronus against the estate of libertus. It is not stated
whether patrona mother of three children had the Papian rights
of patronus against the estate of liberta mother of four children who
dies testate, though we might have conjectured this from her rights
against the estate of libertus.

The rights of patrona mother of children against the estate of
intestate liberta mother of four children was a casus omissus in the
lex Papia Poppaea, apparently, from the inadvertence of the legis-
lator, and accordingly was governed by the provisions of the
Twelve Tables, Except on this point the rights of patrona
mother of two children were the same as the rights of filia patroni
mother of three children. On this point, then, it appears that
patrona had greater rights against the estate of intestate liberta
mother of four children than patronus, for patronus (assuming, as
above, that he had the same rights in testacy and intestacy) was
only entitled to the share of a child, whereas patrona was entitled
to the whole inheritance. The right, however, of patrona was more
precatione, for, descending from the Twelve Tables, it might be
extinguished by change of status, whereas the rights of patronus and
filia patroni, being derived from the lex Papia Poppaea, were un-
affected hy change of status. Novae hereditates legitimae capitis
deminutione non pereunt, sed illae solae quae ex lege duodecim tabu-
larum deferuntur, Inst. 3, 4, 2. ‘ The newly introduced rights of
suecession of the statutory class are not extinguished by change of
status like those conferred by the law of the Twelve Tables.'
