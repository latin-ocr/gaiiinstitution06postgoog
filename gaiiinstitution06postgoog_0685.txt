FORMAL ALIENATION'. 663

the Intention required for a unilateral disposition: to prove the
existence of animus transferendi dominii, without which Tradition
would be a Form without a substance, would want the internal
clement it requires in order to amount to a Disposition. Once

’ let the sequent factor, the intention requisite for a unilateral dis-

position, be proved, and the justa causa, the donandi, credendi,
solvendi animus is immaterial. Thus a misunderstanding between
alienor and alienee respecting the nature of the transaction, the
one intending a loan the other a donation, or the one intending
the discharge of a debt imposed by testament the other the dis-
charge of a debt imposed by stipulation, is immaterial: because
the intention of donation and of loan, of paying a legacy and of
paying a stipulated debt, alike involve the animus transferendi
dominii. Quum in causis dissentiamus, non animadverto cur in-
efficax sit traditio: veluti si ego credam me ex testamento tibi
obligatum esse ut fundum tradam3 tu existimes ex stipulatu tibi
eum deberi. Nam et si pecuniam numeratam tibi tradam donandi
gratia, tu eam quasi creditam accipias, constat proprietatem ad
te transire, nec impedimento esse quod circa causam dandi atque
accipiendi dissensimu8‚ Julian, Dig. 41, 1, 36. An error in respect
of the eausa may be sufficient to entitle an alienor to condictio
indebiti or condictio sine causa3 i. e. to a suit for reconveyance for
want of consideration: but it does not prevent the transmutation.
of ownership in the first instance: and if the property passes on-
ward to a third person the alienor cannot reach it in his hands,
but has only a personal action against the original alienee.

In one particular instance, by special statutory enactment, the
causa traditionis is material to the efficacy of Tradition. Tradition
solvendi animo, when the solutio intended is the performance of
a contract of sale, operates no transmutation of property except in
sales expressly on credit until the purchase money is paid or security
is given for its payment. This, as we have seen, p. 204, was a
provision of the Twelve Tables. Mancipation and J udicial sur-
render were not thus restricted in their operation, but transferred
ownership irrespectively of the payment of purchase money. In
Mancipation the requirement of the Twelve Tables was deemed
to be satisfied by the simulation of payment (isque mihi emptus
est hoc aere aeneaque libra); and possibly, as Ibering suggests,
the requirement of the Twelve Tables was the very reason why the
simulation of payment was introduced into this solemnity.
