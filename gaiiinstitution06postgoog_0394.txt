372 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [111. ἐξ 90, 91.

33 security for the payment of such and such a debt‚ and that such
debt 1133 not been paid [factum]‚ do thou, J udex, condemn the
defendant in damages to the amount of the loss that the plaintiff
shall have sustained‚ unless at thy order he deliver such land to the 4
plaintiff [arbitrium] ; in absence of such proof, pronounce the
defendant’s absolution.’ 4
Besides the actio H ypothecaria‚ whereby the rights of the mort-
gagee were definitively decided‚ there was an Interdictum Salvianum,
4 ᾗ 147, to enable the mortgagee to recover interim or provisional
possession of the thing mortgaged pending the definitive litigation.
ΓἿὺ3 formula was probably something like the following· ‘If such
ι 3οᾶ 30011 3 slave 13 000 of the things respecting which you agreed
2 with the plaintiff that whatever was inducted, illated, imported
,ἶ into such and such land, or was thereon born 01 produced, should
.· 110 pledged to the plaintiff to secure the payment of the rent of
such land3 in that case Ι prohibit your employment of force to
, - „„ hinder the plaintiff from abducting the slave.’ Thus the relation
³ of aetio Hypothecaria to interdictum Salvianum would resemble that
of Vindicatio to the interdict Utrubi or Uti possidetis, 4§ 148, or that
of Hereditatis petitio to the interdict Quorum bonorum, 4 ᾧ 144.
Innominate 01· unnamed contract is 3 Bilateral convention for
reciprocal performances followed by execution on the pm of one
of the contractors. A bilateral Convention followed by execution
is Real; not followed by execution it is 0003003031. Bilateral ,
conventione, Real or ConsensuaI, fall into four classes: Aut enim 4

Dig. 19, 5, 5, pr. ‘ There may be conveyance in consideration of
conveyance‚ or conveyance in consideration of performance, or
performance in consideration of conveyance‚ or performance in con-
sideration of performance? Some of such conventione, though not
followed by execution, would give rise to Named 0003003031 000-
tracte, sale, letting, partnership‚ or mandate; and then would 4

aecompauied by execution whose nature excluded them from these
appellatione would have no legal validity. Those conventione
which to consensus add execution, but fail to satisfy the definitione
of the Named Consensual contracte, are thrown into 3 miscellaneous
class called contracts Innominate. 'ro whatever category they ’
belonged, do ut des, do ut facias, facio ut des, facio ut facias, they 4

 

were enforcible by a civil action called actio in factum praescriptis
