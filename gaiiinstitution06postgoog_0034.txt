12 PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS.

countable. The grounds or conditione of Imputability are Intention
(dolus) and Negligence (culpa), 3 ξ 211. We require, therefore,
the definitions of Intention and Negligence.

Desires or wishes either attain their objects immediately and
instantaneously, or only by the intervention of other objects ante-
cedently attained. The antecedent object is called a ‘ mean,' the
consequent or mediate object is called an ‘ end.' If no object were
immediately attainable, if every mean had to be reached by an
antecedent mean, if the regression of previous conditions was un-
limited‚ all desire would be futile and no end could ever be attained.
There must be, then, some primary mean, some limit to the series
of antecedent conditions‚ some objects of desire attained by a wish.
What is the nature of these objects‚ and what is the name of the
wish by which they are evoked ⁴?

'Phe only objects that man can realize by a wish are the muscular
movements of the bodily organS.

Greek psychology does not appear to have had a proper name for
the wish which produces a movement of the limbs. Doubtless, the
words ὄρεξις and ὀρεκτόν apply to these wishes and their objects,
but they apply equally to ulterior ends or motives, and we want a
term to signify exclusively and distinctively the primary mean.
Again, προαίρεσις (resolve or resolution) denotes the desire of an
original mean, but only one species thereos} namely, desire preceded
by deliberation or premeditation‚ and we are seeking for a name of
all desires that are immediately fulfillod, whether premeditated or
unpremeditated, whether the counsel of reason or the impulse of
unrefiecting passion. For this purpose Will and Volition seem to
be the most appropriate words that the English lang-uage offers.
'though applicable without impropriety to distant ends, they are
perhaps more commonly applied to means, and in particular to the
command we exercise over our bodily frame. We say that we will
a movement‚ that the limbs obey the will, that a bodily movement
follows instantaneously upon a volition. Over whatever regions the
dominion of the Will may be extended‚ the direct origination of motion
in the limbs is its earliest manifestation‚ and continues its principal
function to the end of life. Wanting, then, a term to denote the
wish of an original mean, or rather of an object attainable without
the intervention of means, we take the generic term will or Volition‚
and give it a specific signification, denoting thereby the desire
or wish which is immediately fulfilled3 whether such wish be the
