is charged like a coheres with the legaeies in proportion to the
quota which he takes, he has not like the heres a right of deduct-
ing from tbe legacies with which 119 13 charged, and retaining for
himself a Falcidian portion or fourth of his quota. His rights
against the legates depend on the question whether the testator in
directing the transfer, or in other words creating the trust, used
tbe terms deductis legatis, ‘ after deductiori of 19830193,’ 3 clause
favouring the legatees ς or whether, in giving the legacies, he used

terms charging them on the inheritance (si ad heredis onus esse ’
testator legata dixerit); which would imply that the cestui que ¹

trust was to be exactly assimilated to the legateeS. Where no
terms are expressed, the clause, deductis legatie, is presumed. The
following examples will illustrate the working of the law.

(1) A testator owning 400 (sestertia, or any other units) leaves
all to A as his sole successor, but directs him as trustee (fiduci-
arius) to convey half the inheritance to B (fideicommissarius),
and leaves a legacy of 200 to O. The effect is that C receives 100
from A and 100 from B. D. 36, 1, 1, 20.

But suppose the testator left a legacy of 400 to C. Then C will
receive 200 from B who has no right of retaining anything, and 100
from A, who is entitled to retain for himself one fourth of his
inheritance‚ i. 9. the 100 that remain.

(2) If an heir is charged to transfer the whole of an inheritance
and the legacies are added to his charge (si ad heredis onus esso
testator legata dixerit), the interests of both the legates and trans-
ferree undergo, if necessary, a proportional reduction. For in-
stance a testator, proprietor of 400, makes A his sole successor,
but requests him to transfer the whole succession to B, and gives
a legacy of 300 to C, making use of the above-mentioned terme.
The result is that A„the heir, retains 100 33 1113 Falcidiau fourth,
and the remaining 300 are distributed between B the cestui que
trust and C the legatee in the proportion of 4 to 33 that is to say,
the cestui que trusts takes 2⁴, or 1713, and the legates takes ᾗ or
1284. Dig. 36, 1, 3, pr.

(3) If the testator directs the heir to transfer the whole of the
inheritance ‘after deduction of the legacies’ (deductis legatis), the
transferres bears the whole burden of the legacies, and only keeps
what remains after full payment of the legatee, subject to this
proviso, that, though a transferree is generally not entitled to 3
Falcidian fourth, yet if a transferres who has to bear the burden
