people of Rome, are permitted to in-
dulge in excessivo or causeless harah·
ness towards their slaves. By a
constitution of the Emperor Pius
Antoninus, a man who kills a slave
of whom he is owner, is as liable to
punishment as a man who kiJls a
slave of whom he is not owner: and
inordinate cruelty on the part of
owners is checked by another con-
stitution whereby the same emperor,
in answer to enquiriss from pre-
sidente of provinces concerning
slaves who take refuge at temples

of the gods, or statues of the em· -

peror, commanded that on proof
of intolerable cruelty a proprietor

should be compelled to sall his
slaves: and both ordinans-:es are

just, for it is proper that the abusa

of a lawful right should be re·
strained, a principle recognized in
the intel-diction of rodigals from
the administration o their fortune.

'Phe condition of the slave was at its worst in the golden period
of Roman history. As soon as Rome found her power irresistible
she proceeded to conquer the world, and each stage of conquest was
the reduction of a vast portion of mankind to slavery. 30‚ooo
Tarentines were sent as slaves to Rome by Fabius Cunctator, the
