432 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [m. §§ 155-162.‘

ᾧ 162. It is only in exceptional circumstanceS, such as those
herc mentioned, that the contract of mandatum can fall under the
head of Bailment.

The gratuitous character of mandatum is rather nominal than
real. The professor of a liberal art could recover a remuneration
which, however, was disguised under the name of salarium or
honorarium, and could not be sued for by action of mandate before
an ordinary judge‚ but was a matter for the extraordinary cogni·
zance of the praetor or chief minister os justice. Adversus eum
cujus negotia gesta sunt, de pecunia quam de propriis opibus vel ab
aliis mutuo acceptam erogasti, mandati actione pro sorte et usuris
potes experiri. De salario autem quod promisit, apud praesidem
provinciae. cognitio praebebitur, Cod. 4, 25, 1. ‘ The employer
whose business you transacted, as to the moneys out of your own
pocket or taken up at a loan which you spent for his use, may be
forced hy action of mandate to reimburse you the principal and
interest. The salary which he promised must abide the decision
of the president of the province.’ Under the liberal professions are
included advocateS‚ physicianS‚ oculists, aurists, dentists, copyists
(librarii), short-hand writers (notarii), accouutantS, schoolmasterS,
narses, rhetoricianS, grammarians, geometers, land surveyorS. The
professore of philosophy and of civil law may receive sees volun·

tribunal of the praetor, Dig. 50, 13.

The law of agency or representation was only slowly developed
in Roman jurisprudence. Originally the cases in which a contractor
could bind a principal to his contractee or the contractee to a prin-
cipal were confined to contracte by persons under power, that is to
say, sons or slaves·

The right acquired by a son or slave was acquired for the father
or master, 3 ᾧ 163, and if the contract was made by the order or
for the use of the father or master, he was suable by the contractee,
4 ξς 70-74. But in other cases the benefit or burden of a contract
was confined to the parties contracting. 'Phe procurator or agent
contracted with a third party in his own name: the third party
recovered his dues from the agent by an action on the contract:
and the agent would in turn recover his from the principal by an
action on the mandate. There was no immediate relation between
the third party and the principal, and any action in which the third
