Just as interdict procedure was necessary in order to determine
which litigant should have interim possession pending the vindi-
cati0, so it was necessary to determine who should have interim
possession pending a possibly protracted interdict procedure. This
was accomplished by means of Fructus licitatio, which took place iu
the second appearance before the praetor, and was followed by (a)
the Fructuaria stipulatio.

Each party then wagered a penal sum in two characters, for each
party was both plaintiff and defendant: and, as a sponsio was
a unilateral contract‚ in order to produce a bilateral contract, that
is, to bind both parties and constitute a single bet or wager in the
modern sense of the term, it was necessary to have two stipula-
tionS, that is, a sponsio and a restipulatio. For the purpose, there-
fore, of making two wagers the parties entered into four stipu-
lations (two sponsions and two restipulations)3 i. e. (b) one sponsio
and (e) one restipulatio in which a litigant was promisor and pro·
misce as plaintiffi and (d) a second sponsio and (e) a second resti-
pulatio in which he was promisor and promisee as defendant.
'Phe sponsio would be a stipulation to the following effect: Si
adversus edictum praetoris possidenti mihi vis a te facta est, tot
nummos dare spondes? Spondeo : the restipulatio to the following
effect: Si adversus edictum praetoris possidenti tibi vis a me facta
non est, tot nummos dare spondes Ρ Spondeo. Thereby each party
would be bound to pay, or entitled to receive, two penal sumS,
according as the actions brought on these four stipulations decided
the issue which the stipulatione raised.

A judex was then appointed who tried the four actions,

Then if the victorin the four actions had not been the higher
bidder at the Licitatio, the judex decided a fifth and sixth action ε
namely one called judicium Secutorium or Cascellianum, which had
a formula arbitraria, and whereby possession of the movable οι·
immovable was recovered from the higher bidder3 and another on
(a) the Fructuaria stipulatio, to recover from the higher bidder a
penal sum equal to the value of the fructus, ,

Instead of suing on (a) the Fructuaria stipulatio the victor had
the option of bringing judicium Secutorium for the recovery of this
penal sum, and then he was protected against the event of his op-
ponent‘s insolvency by sureties (satisdatio). It may be asked what
compensating disadvantage of this course should ever induce the
victor to sue on (a) Fructuaria stipulatio. Perhaps, as Krueger
