lv· ξιξ 21-25.] MANUS INIECTIO. 509

ᾗ 22. The lex Furia de sponsu (3 ξ 121), supposed to have been
passed in Β.ο. 95, limited the obligath of the sponsor and fide-
promissor to two years, and divided it equally among all the
sponsores and fidepromissores without regard to their solvency.

The word exegissent suggests that the, lex Furia de sponsu was
not a lex perfecta 3--that the limitation of the sponsor's liability to a
proportionate part of the principal debt was only effected by a penalty
being imposed on the creditor who exacted the whole obligation.

If we assume with Ihering that the lex Furia de sponsu and the
lex Furia testamentaria were separate clauses of the same enactment,
we can understand why manus injectio pro judicato, which was ex-
pressly made the remedy in lex Furia de sponsu, was extended by
interpretation to lex Furia testamentaria: although this extension,
according to Gaius, ξ 24, violated the rules of statute-process, which .
ought to rest in its minutest details on the express provisions of a
statute.

The lex Marcia is supposed to have been passed between ΒΛ). 200
and ΒΛ). 100. Its poena, like that of lex Furia testamentaria,
was quadruplum, Cato de Re Rustica, quoted by Gellius. Penal
actions maintainable by a common informer, were called Populares3
and the informer, from the amount of the penalty, was called
Quadruplator.

Some hold that execution and proceedings in bankruptcy in the
old Roman law were always directed immediately against the person
of the debtor3 execution against his property, under the name of
Bonorum venditi0, 3 ᾧ 77, being a later invention. Savigny, how-
ever, whose view Ι have adopted, supposes that execution against
the person was confined with certain exceptione to judgments on
an actual loan of money, and that execution on other judgments
was always against the estate: and this view, as we have seen,
throws light on an obscure problem, the nature of the ancient con-
tract of Nexum, and renders intelligible the Sc.. Macedonianum.

The caseS‚ other than a judgment debt, in which the creditor

might proceed by Manus injectio seem to be, besides those men· .
