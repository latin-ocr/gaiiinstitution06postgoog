· There was a time when the three tribes of the Populus, the
Ramnes, a Latin or Pelasgis 1666 6661611 011 1116 Palatino hill, the
Tities 01 Quirites, a Sabine race seated on the Capitoline 61111
Quirinal 111116, 61111 1116 Luceres, an Etrurian 1666 seated on the
Caelian 11111, eomposed the whole of the Roman state. These
three tribes ef the Populus were divided into thirty Curiae,
and the Curiae into three hundred Gentes. 'Phe heads of the
Gentes 01 616116 60111Ρο6611 1116 8611616, the heads of the Families
composing the Gentes constituted the popular body, 01 00161116

'rho Plebs or Plebes, a conquered Latin population, whose first
beginnings were located in tbe suburbs (esquiliae) adjoining these
111116, aud named 0616111616 (exquilini) as opposed 10 the burgesses
or insiders (inquilini), and whose large aster-growth was settled by
bonus Ancus on the Aventine (in memory of which Catullus calls
the joint Populus and Plebs, Romulique Ancique gentem), shared
the same jus privatum but not the same jus publicum, that is, were

of the city a separate free but dependent corporation. At this
time it was true, as Gaius says, that the Plebeians and Patricians
were separate bodies.

But this was not so after the legislation of Servius Tullius, 10
whom is ascribed the division of the people into 10661 Τ111166, 61111

The local tribes, probably thirty in number, were a territorial
division, including the whole population, patrician as well as ple-

assembly called Comitia Tributa.

civil division was a classifieation of the whole population according

These of the highest census were distributed 11110 6131116611 cen-

'l'he remainder of the population were divided 11110ι live classes,
