414 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [m.§§135-138.

A Recognizance resembles Stipulation in its form, being entered
into by oral interrogation and answer, but differs in that it can
only be taken before a court or magistrate duly authorized, whereas
stipulatio was transacted between private parties.

A J udgment debt, or debt due by the judgment of a court of
record, is sometimes the result of a judgment in an adverse suit,
but sometimes it is merely a form of written contract, and may be
entered into in various ways. A fictitious action is brought, and
the party to be bound either makes no reply, or fails to instruct his
attorney, or confesses the action and suffers judgment to be at once
entered up; or the party to be bound consents to a judge’s order
authorizing the plaintiff to ‚enter up J udgment and issue execution
against him, either at once and unconditionally‚ or on a future day
conditionally on non-payment of whatever amount may be agreed
upon3 or the party to be bound gives a wari-ant of attorney‚ that
is, authority to an attorney to confess an action pf debt or suffer
judgment to go by default‚ the warrant being accompanied by a
defeazance declaring it to be merely a security for payment of a
certain sum and interest, and providing that no execution shall
issue unless default in the payment shall have been made.

The conj unction of a penal clause and a condition avoiding it is
common to the judgment debt, recognizance‚ bond, and stipulation.
The Roman Nexum, as we have stated, had 'apparently the effect
of a J udgment debt.

consensu dicimus obligationes con-

scripturae ulla proprietas desidera-

gerunt consensisse. unde inter abs-
entes quoque talia negotia contra-

is said to create the obligetiom be-
cause no form of words or of writing
(nor any delivery) is required, but
the consent of the parties is suffici-
