114 DE Pnssoms [1. ξς 132-136.

ξ 134. Assuming that in adoption, as in emancipatiou, the person
to whom the son was mancipated was called pater fiduciarius, we
find in adoption three fathers in the field, pater naturalis, pater
fiduciarius, and pater adoptivus. It appears from ᾧ 135 α that
though the status of bondage was formal or fictitious, yet to give an

air of ⁴reality to the drama, the status was made to have a certain 'z

duration. So when a prince is advanced from the rank of private
to that of general, a certain interval is interposed between the
intermediate promotions for the sake of decorum, though, the whole
proceeding being unreal, all the steps, if the authorities were so
disposed, might be compressed into a single day. Ihering, ξ 46.

'Phe status of paterfamilias or of filiusfamilias being, like other
kinds of status, a real right, the claim of a person as filiusfamilias
was a matter to be contested in a real action or vindicatiO. This
would seem the more obvious to the early juristS, as they probably
drew no distinction between patria potestas and dominica potestaS,
i. e. between paternal power and absolute proprietorship. This
claim was sometimes a matter of contentione (not voluntary) juris-
diction, i. e. of genuine litigation. Per hanc autem actionem liberae
personae quae sunt juris nostri, utputa liberi qui sunt in potestate,
non petuntur . . . . nisi forte adjecta causa quis vindicet. Unde si
quis ita petit, filium suum, vel, in potestate ex jure Romano, videtur
mihi et Pomponius consentire, recte eum egisse; ait enim, adjecta
causa ex lege Quiritium vindicare posse, Dig. 6, 1, 2. ‘ If free
personS, dependent on the plaintiff—for instance, children subject to
his power—are sought to be recovered by vindication, the title or
mode of dependence must be specified in the formula (intentio).
Thus a claim of a person as son, or as subject to power ΒΥ the law of
Rome, even according to Pomponius, is regular: for he says that
the specification of a title under a statute of the Quirites makes the
vindication valid.’ (The anomalous forms, ex jure Romano, ex lege
Quiritium, instead of the usual, ex jure Quiritium, were perhaps
'peculiar to the pleadings in this kind of suit.)

J ustinian simplified the formalities of emancipation and adoption.
He allowed the former to be accomplished by a simple declaration
before a competent magistrate, Inst. 1, 12, 6 ; and the latter by
appearance of the parties before a competent judge and insinuatio
i.e. a memorandum of the transaction in the public records of his
office (actis intervenientibus), Cod. 8, 48, 11.
