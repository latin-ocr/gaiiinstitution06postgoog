In manumission by the Census the interests of the State were
represented by the censor. Censu manumittebantur olim qui lustrali
censu Romae jussu dominorum inter cives Romanos censum pro-
fitebantur, Ulpian 1, 8. ‘ Registry by the censor was an ancient
mode of manumission by the quinquennial census at Rome when
a slave was ordered ΒΥ his owner to make his return of property on
the reg-ister of Roman citizens? Ex jure civili potest esse contentiO, ¹
quum quaeritur, is qui domini voluntate census sit, continuone an ,
ubi lustrum conditum liber sit, Cic. De Orat, 1, 40. ‘ It is a question
of civil law, when a slave is registered with his owner's sanction,
whether his freedom dates from the actual inscription on the
register or from the close of the censorial period.' Ulpian speaks
os the census as a thing of the past. Since the Christian era only
three had been held, the last under Vespasiani, Aa). 74. The only
census which ever took place aster this was in the reign of the
Emperor Decius, Aa). 249.

Soon after manumission ΒΥ census fell into desuetude, a new
form, marking the progress of Christianity, was gradually estab-
lished, and may be regarded as a subffltute for the older form,
manumission in ecclesiis. A constitution of Constantine, aa). 316,
reeognizing its validity‚ mentions that it had been long in practice,
Cod. 1, 13. It was a proceeding before the bishop in the presence

· of the congregation, accompanied with a written record, and was

practised down to the days of feudalism. Cujacius mentions that
the following inscription was to be seen over the door of the ancient
cathedral of Orleans: Ex beneficio Sanctae Crucis, per J oannem
episcopum et per Albertum Sanctae Crucis casatum, factus est liber
Lemtbertus, teste hac sancta ecclesia—‘ ΒΥ the grace of the Holy
Cross, and ΒΥ the ministry of Bishop Joannes, Albertus‚ vassal of
the Holy Crosa, manumitted Lemtbertus in the presence of this
holy Church.’

In manumission ΒΥ Vindicta the State was represented by the
Praetor. 'Phe vindicta or festuca was a rod or staff, representing
a lance, the symbol of dominion, with which the parties in a real
aetion (vindicatio) touched the subject of litigation as they solemnly
pronounced their claim. Accordingly it was used in a suit respect-
ing freedom (liberalis causa), for this, as status is a real right (jus
ia rem), was a form of real action, and was sometimes prosecuted

grant of liberty, that is, a species of alienation by surrender in the
