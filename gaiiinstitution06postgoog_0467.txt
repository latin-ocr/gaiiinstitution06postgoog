nova-tion by verbal cont-raet, provided that the subsequent obliga-
tion binds either by law civil or by law natural, as the promise of a
ward without his guardian's authority?

ᾗ 177. We have already seen an instance of novation when treat-
ing of delegatio, 2 ᾧ 38, the satisfaction of a debt by substitution of
a debtor. The substituted debtor who discharges the first is called
expromissor, 3 ᾧ 139, commentary.

ᾧ 178. We see by J ustinian‚ Inst. 3, 29, 3, that the addition or
omission„ of a fidejussor was finally held to operate a novation.

ᾧ 179. Servius Sulpicius was wrong because novation implies
a subsequent obligatiou, but a conditional obligation is really no

 

obligation until the condition is realized. So* if the prior obligation ,aa J

is conditional and the second obligation absolute, the novation is
not absolute but conditional, because there is really no prior
obligation until the condition is realized, at which moment novation
takes place, and the prior obligation is extinguished.

Justinian enacted that no contract should operate a novation,
unless the stipulating parties expressly declared their intention that
such novation should be produced, Inst. 3, 29, 3.

pars dicere solet: Testes estote. Festus· ‘ Contestation is when
both parties exclaim, “ Give your attestation.’' It marks the defi-
nitive settlement of the issue to be tried.’ Under the formulary
system the term was still employed, but marked the moment when
the praetor delivered the written formula containing the commission
of the judex, Under the third period of the law, when the praetor
or highest judicial funct-ionary was himself the judex, that is, no
longer delegated the cause to an inferior authority (judex pedaneus),
but heard and determined it himself, Litis Contestat-io denoted the]
commencement of the trial before the judex. Lis enim tunc con· ⁹
testata videtur, quum judex per narrationem negotii causam audire
coeperit, Cod. 3, 9, 1. ‘ Litis contestatio is the moment when the
judge begins to hear the rec-ital of the cause of action.’ By legitima
