to prove, but apparently without success, that regressus is an
incident of Correality.) Where, however, the Solidarity is the effect
of eo-delinquency (Ne. a. above) the delinquent who pays has no
regressus.

After this preliminary consideration of the nature of Correality
we are in a position to examine the nature of Guaranty or Surety-
ship, and to fix the relation of fidejussiO, one of the latest devel-
opments of Suretyship, to other cognate institutions of Roman
jurisprudenee.

Fidejussio is a species of Inmncnss105 and accordingly the above
mentioned object requires usto examine the nature and subdivisione
of IntercessiO.

Intercession is the assumption of liability for the debt of another
person by negotiation or contract with his creditor. For instance,
when a person is hesitating whether he shall accept a succession
because he has doubts whether it is solvent, that is, whether the
assets exeeed the liabilities‚ to induce him to aecept it by a promise
of indemni fication, is not intercession, because here there is no contract
with a creditor: but if the ground of his hesitation is a suspicion that
the debtors to the inheritance are insolvent, to induce him to accept
the inheritance by a promise to make good what he fails to recover from
the debtors is Intercession, for here is a contraot with a creditor.

Intercession is either (A) Privative or (B) Cumulative.

A. Privative Intercession is the substitution of one obligation
for another.

(1) Substitution for an actually pre-existent debt involves No-
VA'moN, i. e. the extinction of such preceding debt, and is called
EXPROMISSIO. Expromission, the discharge of a debtor by taking
his place in relation to the creditor, may be considered as including
Defensio, the defence of an absent debtor in a suit instituted by
the creditor3 for then the volunteer defendant became liable to
condemnatiou in place of the original debtor: Suscipit enim in se
alienam obligationem, quippe quum ex hac re subeat condemna-
tionem, Dig.· 16, l, 2. As the act of the former debtor, this
substitution is called DELEGATIO, or, divested of its stipulatory form,
AssmNA'rm. ExpromissiO, then, and Delegatio are the same dis·
position viewed from different sideS.

(2) Substitution, not for an actually pre-existent obligation
which is novated, but for an obligation which would have to be
incurred by another person if the present obligation were not
