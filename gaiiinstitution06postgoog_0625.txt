The collision of the rights os the plaintiff and defendant, as ex-
pressed in the intentio and exceptio arises in the majority of cases
from the opposition of equity (aequitas) to law, jus strictum, or of
jus praetorium to jus civile.

Instances of exceptio founded on jus praetorium are: Exceptio
doli, metus, pacti conventi, ᾧ 116, hypothecaria, jurisjurandi.

It ie, however, erroneous to suppose, as was done in the first
edition, that, anomalies disregarded, exceptio is always a plea based
on the equitable or praetorian code. This ,is contrary to the state-
ment of Gaius, § 118, that exceptio is often based on jus civile, and
refuted by the following examples of exceptione based on civil law:
exceptio dominii, the allegation of civil dominion by the true
proprietor who is defendant in an actio publicisne. brought by a
purchaser from a non-proprietor: exceptio legis Plaetoriae‚ the al-
legation of minority. [The lex Plaetoria did not make minore
incapable of contracting, but treated their inexperience as a ground
for extraordinary relief ε otherwise minority, like infancy, would
have made a contract null and void, and its averment would not
have fallen as an exceptio under the third mode of defence, but,
as a negation, under the first, like the avet-ment of infancy]:
exceptio legis Cinciae, Frag. Vat. 266, 310, protecting a donor:
exceptio legis J uliae, Inst. 4, 14, 4, protecting an insolvent who has
made cessio bonorum: exceptio Sc. Macedoniani, protecting filius-
familias against usurers: exceptio Sc. Velleiani, protecting women
from the consequences of intercessio: exceptio Sc. Trebelliani, pro-
tecting an heir who is merely a trustee to convey the inheritance
to a beneficiary from the pursuit of the creditore, Dig. 15, 2, 1, 8.

ἣ Let us examine the meaning of ipsum jus as it occurs in the
opposition of aetio ipso jure nulla (a right avoided by a destructive
plea) and actio ope exceptionis infirmata (a right counteracted by
an obstructive plea) or other equivalent expressions.

Ipsum jus sometimes denotes jus civile as opposed to jus prae-
torium, e. g. in the phrase actiones quae in aliquem aut ipso jure

' competunt aut a praetore dantur, 4 ξ 112: but this cannot be its

signification here; for the opposition between destruction and
obstruction, avoidance and counteraction, is irrespective of the
opposition between jus civile and jus praetorium. In a case of
avoidance, the plaintiff’s claim may be derived not from jus civile
but from jus praetorium, e. g. in actio constitutoria, hypothecaria,
publiciana: and in a case of counteraction the defendant’s plea, as
