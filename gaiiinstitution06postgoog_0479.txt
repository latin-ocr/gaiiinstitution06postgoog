scripserunt de eo qui in aciem per-
duxisset.

ξ 197. Placuit tamen eos qui re-
bus commodatis aliter uterentur
quam utendas accepissent, ita fur-
tum committere, si intellegant id se
invito domino facere, eumque, si
intellexisset, non permissurum 3 et
si permissurum crederent, extra
furti crimen videri: optima sane
distinctione, quia furtum sine dolo
malo non committitur.

§ 198. Sed et si credat aliquis
invito domino se rem contrectare,
domino autem volente id fiat, dici-
tur furtum non fieri. unde illud
quaesitum est, cum Titius servum
meum sollicitant, ut quasdam res
mihi subriperet et ad eum perfer-
ret, et servus id ad me pertulerit,
eg0, dum volo Titium in ipso de-
licto deprehendere, permiserim ser-
vo quasdam res ad eum perferre,
utrum furti, an servi corrupti iu-
dicio teneatur Titius mihi, an neutro:
responsum, neutro eum teneri, furti
ideo quod non invito me res con-
trectarit, servi corrupti ideo quod
deterior servus factus non est.

§ 199. Interdum autem etiam
liberorum hominum furtum fit, ve-
lut si quis liberorum nostrorum qui
in potestate nostra sunt, sive etiam
uxor quae in manu nostra sit, sive
etiam iudicatus vel auctoratus meus
subreptus fuerit.

ξ 200. Aliquando etiam suae rei
quisque furtum committit, veluti si
debitor rem quam creditori pignori
dedit subtraxerit, vel si bonae fidei
possessori rem meam possidenti
subripuerim. unde placuit eum qni
servum snum quem alius bona fide
possidebat ad se reversum celaverit
hirtum committere.

the neighbourhood; or, like the man
in the old case, to take it into battle.

ξ 197. It is held, however, that
putting a thing lent for use to a
different use than the lender con·
templated is only theft if the bor-
rower knows it to be contrary to
the will of the owner, and that, if
he had notice, he would refuse per-
mission3 but if he believes that the
owner would give permission‚ it is
not theft3 and the distinction is
just, for there is no theft without
unlawful intention.

ξ 198. To deal with a thing in
the belief that you are acting against
the will of the owner, whereas the
owner is consenting, is said not 10
be theft; whence a question arises,
if Titius solicits my slave to 61661
my property, and convey it to him,
and my slave informs me of it, and
Ι, wishing to detect Titius in flag-
rante delicto, permit my slave to

slave be maintained against Titius'l
It has been held that neither action
is maintainable ς not theft, because I
consentedto his dealing with my pro-
perty ; not corruptinga slave, because
the slave resisted the solicitation.

ξ 199. Α freeman may be the
subject of a theft3 for instance, a
child in my power, a wife in my
hand, my insolvent debtor, or my
hired gladiator, if secretly removed
from my control.

§2oo. A man sometimes steals
his own property; for instance, a
debtor who purloins the goods which
he has pledged to a creditor, or a
proprietor who steals his property
from a bona fide possessor3 and
accordingly it has been held, that
concealment of one's slave, who,
being possessed in good saith by
another had returned to his owner,
amounted to theft
