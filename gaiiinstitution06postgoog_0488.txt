466 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [111. ξς 210-219.

This constitution may be regarded as the final blow struck by the
Roman legislator at the archaic form of remedial procedure—private
violence or self-redreSS. In archaic society, if society it could
be called, before the establishment of central authority, public
tribunals, and police or executive functionarieS, such was the only
possible means of redress3 and such redress was recognized and
permitted by primeval law, if the sentiments of the tribe at such a
period can be called by the name of law.

Among the German races the disorder implied by the toleration
of Feud or private war was gradually mitigated by the introduction
of certain TruceS, or temporary or local Peaces: the Truce of the
King, prohibiting private war within the precincts of the royal
residence: the Truce of the Church, giving to the fugitive wrong-
doer an asylum in the sanctuary: the Truce of the Assembly, ex-
cluding the prosecution of feuds from the place where the Hundred
was assembled z and the Truce of the Town, Village, or House‚ pro-
tecting· the offender from homicidal attack within these limite.

At some period, ton, society interposed and offered to act as arbi-
trator, and to procure for the aggrieved party satisfaction of the
wrong he had endured. Accordingly all injuries were rated at a
certain tariff, and a person who had suffered aggression had the
option whether he should avenge himself or, in commutation of his
right of Feud, accept the fine fixed by this tariff, and awarded by a
tribunal of his countrymen. This mediation of the communit-y,
which the plaintiff could accept or decline at his discretion, was the
origin of actiones poenaleS‚ the poena being the inducement offered
to the plaintiff to make him adopt the more peaceful course. In
Saxon law the alternative offered to the aggressor was expressed by
the maxim Biege spere of side other bere: ‘ Buy the spear off the
side or bear it :' i. e. make atonement or be liable to Feud. (Kemble).

Finally the Peace of the King, proclaimed at each coronation,
became universal z the state under-took the decision and composition
of all quarrels3 and private war at all times and in all places was
interdicted and superseded by recourse to the public judicaturo.
