the judex was empowered to consider allegatione of bad faith, the
defrauded purchaser would not have been without a remedy. But,
as Savigny points out, Cicero had guarded against this objection by
a certain feature which he gives to the narrative. Emit homo
cupidus et locuples tanti quanti Pythius voluit, et emit instructos.
Nomina facit, negotium conficit. ‘ The purchaser was eager and
rich, he bought at the price the seller named, and he bought the
gardens ready fumished. The contract is by expensilati03 the
business is concluded.' Nomen, which sometimes significa any
debt, is here used, in a specific sense, for a debt created by Literal
contract3 accordingly, nomina facit implies that the purchase‚ as
soon as concluded, had been novated, ξ 176, i. e. extinguished by
metamorphosis into a ledger debt3 so that the transaction was
removed from the domain of equity to that of civil law, which in
its primitive simplicity had no provision for dolus 11101110.

Transcription a persona in personam was the substitution or
exchange of a debt owed by C to B, in discharge of a debt owed by
B to A; or, at all events, the substitution of C in lieu of B as
debtor to A. It is impossible to form an exact conception of the
mode in which these transcriptione were operated without a greater
knowledge than we possess of the Roman method of book-keeping.
Nomen facere, as we have just stated, is to contract a debt by literal
obligation. Nomen signifies the name of the dehtor, as in the line
of Horace: Scriptos nominibus certis expendere nummos 3 ‘ Recorded
on his ledger to lend moneys to solvent borrowers ς’ and in the
following passage of the Digest: Si plures sint rei stipulandi‚ vel
plures argentarii, quorum nomina simul facta sunt, unius 1000
numerabuntur, quia unum debitum est, Dig. 2, 14, 9. ‘ Several
joint promisees in a stipulation, or several bankers in whose respec-
tive books the same debtor is contemporaneously debited with the
same sum, count as one creditor in insolvency, because there is but
one debt.’ In the business of bankers (argentarii), whose book-
keeping of course was extremely regular, the Literal contr-act
appears to have survived when it had fallen into desuetude in other
quarters.

The word Transcriptitia may refer to the transfer involved in
Novation: Savigny however prefers the following origin of the
term. The Roman account-book (tabulae accepti et expensi), he
supposes, was essentially 0 Cash-book: 0 record of incomings and
outgoings of actual cash: i. e. the monthly or annual balance of
