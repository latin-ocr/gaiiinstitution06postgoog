prescription in actiones perpetuae, but holds that Litis contestatio
(a later event) produces this effect in actiones temporales. Savigny
points out, ᾧ 242, that interruption by Litis contestatio in the
case of actiones temporales is not mentioned in the Digest because
it survived in the time of Justinian, but because the older jurists
who speak of interruption were unacquainted with any prescription
of actiones perpetuae, these being, in early times, imprescriptible.
We must distinguish between the interruption and the mere *
suspension, dormancy, or stay, of prescription. When prescription ι
is interrupted (for instance, by acknowledgment of the debt) the ’ἓ
already elapsed period of inactivity on the part of the plaintiff is
cancelled and the whole prescription must recommence from the
date of the interruption. When prescription is suspended, if such
suspension takes place after prescription has begun to run, the
period which has elapsed is not invalidated but is added to the
period which follows the removal of the obstacle which caused the
suspension. Suspension, as expressed in the modern maxim : Agere
non valenti non currit praescriptio, is produced by some inability

of the plaintiff to sue ε e. g. by the infancy of the defendant either ·

in perpetual or tempora! actions: by the minority of the defendant
in perpetual but not in temporal actions, Cod. 2, 41, 5: by the
obstacles recognized in the rules of tempus utile, p. 255, and by the
beneficium deliberandi accorded to the successor, p. 254. By the
ordinance de tigno injuncto in the Twelve Tables the right of the
owner of building materials to sue for them was suspended so
long as they formed part of a building, Inst. 2, 1, 7, 10.

Εξςςρῒίοῃ had sometimes a stronger, sometimes a weaker, oper-
ation: the stronger effect is the neutralizing of both civilis ands
naturalis obligatio. Such is the effect of the exceptio Sc. Vellei-
ani. The weaker operation is a bar to civilis obligatiO, bffffleaves
naturalis obligatio unimpeded and is instanced by exceptio Sc. Ma-
cedoniani. Naturalis obligatio, as we have already mentioned,
besides the negative feature that it is not a ground to support an
action has six positive features: it excludes indebiti condictio in the
event of payment by mistake, and it is a ground to support com-
pensatio, novatiO‚ pig-nm, fidejussi0‚ constitutum. Let us examine
whether prescription or Exceptio temporalis had the weaker or the
stronger operation.

We must distinguish between Real and Personal actionS.
