integrum restitutio. Even the existence of a curator did not
deprive the minor of his right of restitution‚ but of course it could
not be obtained so readily as when he acted without the advice of a
curator.

The tutor and curator were entirely separate functionariee ε when
women were under perpetual tutelage, a woman might have both
a tutor and a curator. The curator of a minor must be dis-
tinguished from an agent (procurator), a person invested with
certain rights and dutieS‚ which will be explained when we examine
the different kinds of contract. An agent is governed by the in-
structions (mandatum) of hie principal z a minor ie under the direc-
tion of his curator: the employment of an agent is a private
matter, purely voluntary on the part of the principal 3 the
curator ie a public functionary, and having one is to a certain
extent involuntary on the part of the minor.

Besidee minore, lunatice and prodigals of whatever age were
committed to the charge of curatore. The curatio of lunatice and
prodigale ie, indeed, older than that of minore, being regulated by
the Twelve Tables, which directed that the nearest agnate should
be committee of a lunatio, and manage the estate of an interdicted
prodigal. In later times it was usual for the praetor or praeses
provinciae to appoint a curator aster inqueet (ex inquisitione).
Paulus has preserved the form of words in which the prodigal was
interdicted: Moribus per praetorem bonis interdicitur hoc modo:

tuos ad egestatem perducis, ob eam rem tibi ea re commercioque
interdico, 3, 4 a, 7. ‘ By customary law the praetor interdicte a
prodigal from the administration of his property in the following
terme: As thy profligacy ie wasting- the estate of thy father and
ancestorS, and bringing thy children to destitution, I therefore
interdict thee from the control of thy patrimony, and from all
disposition of property.'

From ᾧ 189 it might appear that Gaius referred the institution
of guardianship to the code of J us Gentium. We have, however,
quoted from the Digest, ᾧ 142, a passage which ascribes it to J ue
Civile: and, indeed, no institution containing numerical definitione
(fixing, for example, on 12 and 14 for the years of puberty of the
two sexes, and 25 for the year of majority of both sexes, without
