488 DE ACTIONIBUS. [w. ξς 1-9.

me invito, utendi fruendi. In this action the plaintiff, probably, was
not bound to prove a negative, but only the existence of his own
dominion3 it would then be incumbent on the defendant to prove
affirmatively a limitation of this dominion.

The coexistence of actio confessoria and actio negatoria with the ·

antithesis of Positive and Negative servitudes is at first sight
embarrassing: for we might suppose that an actio Confessoria of a
jus altius tollendi was equivalent to an actio Negatoria of a jus
altius Non tollendi3 and that an actio Confessoria of a jus altius
Non tollendi was equivalent to an actio Negatoria of a jus altius
tollendi: so that the law would be encumbered by a redundancy of
forms. .
The following appears to be the explanation and to reconcile
statements in our authorities which at first sight are inconsistent.
The nature of the Servitude, Positive or Negative, alleged by the
plaintiff and, consequentially, the character of the action, Confessoria
or Negatoria, which he instituted, depended on the nature of the
facts on which he relied aswhis title and on the nature of the allegas
tions by which the defendant opposed his claim.

The plaintiff asserted a right of raising the height of his house by
an actio Confessoria of a jus altius tollendi, consistently with the
statement of Gaius, 4 ᾧ 3, if he alleged the Extinction of a former
jus altius Non tollendi, i. e. the recovery of his original freedom ;
for we have mentioned, 2 ᾧ 31, that the extinction of an Urban
servitude could only be accomplished by the erection of a contrary
or antagonistic servitude: he asserted it by an actio Negatoria of a
jus Non altius tollendi 3 consistently with Dig. 8, 5, 4, 7, (competit
etiam de servitute actio domino aedificii Neganti servitutem se
vicino debere) if he denied that such a jus Non altius tollendi
had ever existed.

Similarly a right of prohibiting a neighbour from raising
the height of his house would probably be asserted by actio
Confessoria of jus Non altius tollendi if the defendant denied that
such a right had ever existed: by actio Negatoria of jus altius
toqllendi, consistently wit-h Inst. 4, 6, 2, (si quis intendat jus non
esse adversario . . . altius tollendi . . . istae quoque actiones in rem
sunt sed Negativae), if the defendant contended that, though it
once existed, it had been extinguished by usucapio libertatis.

Whether an action was Confessoria or Negatoria was perhaps
not manifest on the face of the intentio but depended on the
