111. §§ 142-147.] DE LOCATIONE ET CONDUOTION E.

placuit eorum qui integri exierint
locationem et conductionem con·
tractam videri, et eorum qui occisi
aut debilitati sunt emptionem et
venditionem esse: idque ex acci-
dentibus apparet, tamquam sub
condicione facta cuiusque vendi-
tione an locatione. iam enim non
dubitatur, quin sub condicione res
veniri aut locari possint.

ξ 147. Item quaeritur, si cum
aurifice mihi convenerit, ut is ex
auro suo certi ponderis certaeque
formae anulos mihi faceret, et ac-
ciperit verbi gratia denarios ce,
utrum emptio et venditio, an lo-
catio et conductio contrahatur. Cas-
sius ait materiae quidem emptionem
venditionem contrahi, operarum
autem. locationem et conductionem.
sed plerisque placuit emptionem et
venditionem contrahi. atqui si meum
aurum ei dedere, mercede pro opera

it is disputed whether the contract
is one of purchase and sale or of
letting and hiring3 but the better
opinion is that the unharmed were
let and hired, the killed or disabled
were bought and sold, the contracts
depending on contingent events, and
each gladiator being the subject of
a conditional hiring and a con-
ditional sale, for it is certain that
both hiring and sale may be con-
ditional.

§ 147. Again, if a goldsmith
agrees to make me rings of a certain
weight and fashion out of his own
gold for, say, two hundred denarii,
it is a question whether the con-
tract is purcliase and sale or letting
and hiring. Cassius says the ma-
terial is bought and sold, the labour
is let and hired, but most writers
hold that there is only a purchase
and sale. If I provide the gold and
agree to pay him for his work, the
contract is clearly a letting and

ductionem contrahi.

ἧ 143. J ustinian deeided that a hiring for a sum to be fixed hy
an arbitrator was valid, like a sale on similar terms, if the arbi-
trator made his award3 but that if the sum was left to the future
agreement of the partieS, or, ᾧ 144, if the consideration was not
pecuniary but a reciprocal service, the convention was not a Con-
sensual one of letting and hiring, but a Real eontraet innominata,
deriving its validity from part execution, and to be enforeed by the
action in factum praescriptis verbis, Inst. 3, 24, 1.

ᾧ 145. Where Gaius speaks of ager vectigalis, J ustinian speaks
of ager emphyteuticus or emphyteuticariuS, because in his days the
rules of these two kinds of tenure had been entirely assimilateda
Ager vectigalis was land leased by the Roman people, or a munici-
pality, or a sacerdotal college, or the Vestal Virgins, for various
terms of years, for a rent either in money or in produce, usually
amounting to one fifth or one seventh of the profits. Emphyteusis

was the grant of land in perpetuity, or for a term of years, for an
annual rent, subject to forfeiture, without claim for meliorations, on

non-payment of rent by the emphyteuta for three years, or for two
