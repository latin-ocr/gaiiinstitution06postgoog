shows that in Roman law an unlawful inception of possession is not
an essential element in the definition of furtum.

§ 198. J ustinian decided that the attempt to corrupt a slave was

be sued both for theft and for corrupting a slave, Inst. 4, 1, 8.

usureceptio, or usucapion of the property of a mortgagee have been
mentioned in the preceding book. See 2 Q 52-60. μ

ᾅ 202. Α person who is present aiding and abetting when an
offence is committed but is not the actual perpetrator is called, in
English law, a principal in the second degree. He who procures

nec manifestum were purely penal. 'Phe owner could further re-
cover restitution of thing stolen by a real action (vindicatio)
