ἕ 61. Brother and sister, indeed,
are rohibited from inter-marriage
whet er they are born of the same
father and mother or have only one
parent in common: but though an
adoptive sister cannot, during the
subsistence of the adoption, become

a man's wife, yet if the adoption is f ·

dissolved by her emancipation‚ or if
the man is emancipated, there is no
impediment to their intermarriage.

his brother’s daughter Agrippina,
but may not marry his sister’s
daughter, a distinction laid down
in imperial constitutions, nor may
he marry his father¹s sister or his
mother’s sister.

ξ 63. He may not marryone who
has been his wife’s mother or his
son's wife or his wife's daughter or
his father's wife. I say, one who
has been so allied, because during
the continuance of the marriage
that produced the alliance there
would be another impediment to
the union, for a man cannot have
two wives nor a woman two hus-
hands.

§64. A man who contracte a
nefarious and incestuous marriage
is not deemed to have either a wife
or children3 for the offspring of
such a union are deemed to have
a mother but no father, and there-

power, resembling children born
