ιν. §5 45-52.] coNnEMNATIO moERTA. 53⁷

ulla taxatione in infinitum juraverit damnandus est. Si vero nec
potest restituere, nee dolo fecit quo minus possit, non pluris quam
quanti res est, id est, quanti adversarii interfuit, condemnandus est.
Haec sententia generalis est, et ad omnia sive interdicta sive ac·
tiones, et sive in rem sive in personam sint, ex quibus arbitratu
judicis quid restituitur, locum habet, Dig. 6, 1, 68. ‘If a defen·
dant allege inability to obey an order of restitution, if the thing
exists, the court uses the military power to put the plaintiff in
possession, and only condemns the defendant for the mesne profits
and deteriorations. If the defendant has maliciously disabled
himself from restitution, he is condemned in the amount, subject
to no taxation, at which the plaintiff on oath assesses his loss 3 if
the inability is not maliciously produced, the judge assesses the
damages. This applies to all interdicte and actions, real and per-
sonal, where the court orders restitution.' Only in certain obli-
gations of performance or non-performance the condemnation was
still pecuniary: Quia non facit quod promisit in pecuniam nu-
meratam condemnatur, sicut evenit in omnibus faciendi obliga-
tionibus, Dig. 42, 1, 13.

ᾧ 49. In condictio Certi, as we have seen, ᾗ 5, both the Intentio
and the condemnatio are certae: in condictio Triticaria, as in Real
actions, the Intentio, naming certa res, is certa3 but the Condem-
natio, containing the words, Quanti ea res est, is ineerta. A loan
(numeratio, mutuum) of money (pecunia certa credita) always gave
rise to a condictio certi and could not be recovered by any other
form of suit: whereas a loan of any other quantitas (corn, wine, oil,
διο.) founded a condictio triticaria. The difference of the formulae in
these actions explains the following rule of substantive law, which
otherwise seems capricious: A valid informal convention (nudum
pactum) for interest could be annexed to a loan of corn, wine, or
oil, Ood. 4, 32, 23, but not to a loan of money, Dig. 19, 5, 24.

The reason was thist the loan of any other quantitas than money,
having an incerta condemnatio, allowed the judge of a suit brought
for recovery of the principal to include interest in the sum
which he condemned the defendant to pay: whereas the money
loan having a certa condemnatio, coinciding with the intentio in
the sum it defined, the judge of a suit brought for the principal‚
under pain of litem suam facere, ᾧ 52, could only condemn the
defendant to pay the principal.

If, then, interest on a loan of money was intemd to be paid, it
