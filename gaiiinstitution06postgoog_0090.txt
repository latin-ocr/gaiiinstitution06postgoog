brief explanation. Without the right to Honour, one of the
primordial rights of humanity‚ a man is scarcely a freeman‚ and,
accordingly, this right vests definitively in filiusfamilias, and does
not again pass out of him to vest in his father. Any dishonouring
outrage, therefore, gave filiusfamilias a right of bringing a civil
action, called actio injuriarum, in his own name, and, if the offence
was atrocious, or his father-'s character dubious, without his father's
consent, Dig. 47, 10, 17, 13, although any pecuniary damages that
he thereby recovered, being in the nature of property, were re-
covered for his father. The son under power was recognized, then,
as invested with a vindictive right, though not with a proprietary
right. The actio injuriarum was an action in bonum et aequum
concepta (compare Dig. 44, 10, 11, 1, and Dig. 44. 7, 34, pr.),
that is, the terms of the formula (conceptio) directed the judex to
assess the damages not on any principle of civil law, but ΒΥ 1110
own sense of natural equity (aequum et bonum), and this form may
have helped to make the action maintainable ΒΥ 000 who on the
principles of civil law was incompetent to sue. The interdici: quod
vi aut clam was maintainable ΒΥ filiusfamilias on the same principle
as the actio injuriarum, being a means of vindicating a dishonour-
ing outrage inflicted on filiusfamilias ΒΥ 00010 violent disturbance
of real property in defiance of his prohibitio or summons to stay
operatione and let the matter abide the result of a judicial trial.
On the same principle a filiusfamilias disinherited or passed over in
the will of his mother or maternal grandfather, as such disinherit-
auce or pretermission was an implied imputation of turpitude or
unworthiness and therefore dishonouring‚ might without the con-
sent of his father (Dig. 5 , 2, 22, pr.) vindicate his honour ΒΥ
impeaching the will of inofficiositas (immorality‚ or want of natural
affection), although such querela inofficiosi testamenti, being in
another point of view an hereditatis petitio or real action, was not
properly maintainable ΒΥ a' filiusfamilias. If the plaintiff filius—
familias could show that the disinheritance or omission was not due
to his own demerits, he invalidated the will ΒΥ a fictitious pre-
sumption of the testator’s lunacy and made the testator intestate;
and thus filiusfamilias vindicated his own character, but whatever
share he recovered in the intestate succession vested in his father.
'Phe right of filiusfamilias to sue ΒΥ actio commodati or depositi
was founded on a different principle. Suppose that filiusfamilias
had borrowed or hired a thing that he afterwards lent or deposited3
