ξ 26. Nam liberos omnes qui le·
gitimo iure deficiuntur vocat ad
hereditatem proinde ac si in potes·
tate parentum mortis ‘tempore fuis-

gradu vocat quo per legem vocaren-
tur, si capite minuti non essent;
sed tertio, proximitatis nomine:
licet enim capitis deminutione ius
legitimum perdiderint, certe cog-
nationis iura retinent. itaque si quis
alius sit qui integrum ius agnationis
habebit, is potior erit, etiam si
longiore gradu fuerit.

ξ 28. Idem iuris est, ut quidam

ξ 29. Feminae certe agnatae quae
consanguineorum gradum excedunt
tertio gradu vocantur, id est si ne-

husband the mother has become
a quasi sister to her children.

ξ 25. But to these legal inequali-
ties the edict, of the praetor ad-
ministers a corrective.

§26. All children whose statutory
title fails are called by the praetor
to the succession, just as if they had
been in the power of their parent at
the time of his decease‚ whether
they come alone or in concurrence
with sels-successors, that is, with
other children who were subject to
the power of the parent.

ξ 27. Agnates who have de·
scended in status are called by the
praetor, not indeed in the next
degree to sels-successore, that ie, in
the order in which the statute would
have called them but for their loss
of status, but in the third rank
under the designation of cognates

escant in status has blotted out
their statutory title, they neverthc-
less are still entitled as cognates;
but if another person exists with
unimpaired title by agnation, he is
called in preference, although he may
be an agnate in a remoter degree.

ξ 28. The rule is similar, accord-

of a nearer agnate3 according to
others, the praetor calls him to the
succession in the order allotted by
