Another important division of contracta is into UNILATBRAL
and BILATERAL. Wherever mutual promises are proffered and
accepted there are in strictness two or more conventions3 but where
the performance of either of the promises is made to depe-nd on the
performance of tbe other, the several conventione are cross or impli-
cated conventions, and therefore are commonly deemed one conven-
tion. Where one only of the agreeing parties gives a promise, the
proffered and accepted promise is called a Unilateral convention;
where each gives a promise, and the performance of either is made
to depend on the performance of the other, the several proffered and
accepted promises are called a Bilateral or Synallagmatic conven-
tion. But strictly speaking, as before stated, every convention is
Unilateral, and every Bilateral convention is formed by the impli-
cation of several Unilateral conventione. 'Phe sole Unilateral con-
ventions are Expensilatio, StipulatiO, Mutuum. venditio, LocatiO,
Societas, are examples of Bilateral conventions. Depositum, Com-
modatum, Pignus, Mandatum, are called imperfectly Bilateral con-
ventione, because they do not necessarily and originally produce
any reciprocal obligation, but only ex postfacto, i. e. in consequence
of some occurrence subsequent to the convention. The action
founded on the original obligation of a semi-bilateral convention,
i. e. the action of the depositor, lender for use, pawnor, principal‚
is called judicium directum: the action founded on the accidental
or ex postfacto obligation, i. e. the action of the depositary‚ borrower
for use, pawnee, agent, is called judicium contrarium. Unilateral
conventinus, even though, like Mutuum, institutione of J us gen-
tium, give rise to condictiones or actions of strict civil law (stricti
juris actiones) 3 bilateral and semi-bilateral conventions give rise to
equitable actions (bonae fidei actiones).

The terms Unilateral and Bilateral have already been used to
differentiate the genus of Contract, Disposition: and it may be
useful to notice the difference of meaning which these terms bear
in the two connections. A Unilateral Disposition is one made by
a solitary principal disposer: e. g. in testamentary disposition all
other persons who intervene are accessory and subordinate to the
testator. A Bilateral Disposition, or Contract, or Convention, is
one where there are two coordinate principal disposers. A Uni-
lateral convention is one where there is a single promissor and
