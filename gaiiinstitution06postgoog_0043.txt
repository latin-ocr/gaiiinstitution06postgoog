PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS. 21

The knowledge of law, however, which everybody is presumed to
possess, does not exist as a matter of fact, even among the well-
disposed. All systems of law are more or less irrational‚ and con-
tain many provisions which are hardly surmisable by any but
professional lawyers, To mitigate the injustice that the maxim
would often produce, the Roman jurists admitted an exception in
famur &Qhelmmfl—sssmf-QQ
These classes were permitted to plead ignorance of the law, excep
the obvious dictates of Natural law, and were relieved against
the forfeitures aud obligations thereby incur-red. These classes
were excused for ignorance of the more positive and arbitrary
portione of the penal code. Thus women and minors are ex-
cused for ignorance of the incestuous nature of marriage with
collaterals 3 but are not excused for violatiug the law against mar·
riage with ascendants or descendants, a law which is a precept of
jus gentium.

Beffldes the term Ignorance or Error, the above-quoted definition
of the Voluntary and Involuntary contains the term Force (Vis);
we accordingly require a precise conception of Force. Force is of
two kinds, Vis absoluta, and Vis compulsiva. Vis absoluta is
physical force, superseding the Volition of the agent in the pro-
duction of an effect3 as, for instance‘when a person forces another
to sign a document by holding and guiding his hand3 and such
force makes an act Involuntary. Vis compulsiva, Compulsion or
intimidation (metus), e. g. inducing a man to sign by means of
threats, leaves an action Voluntary. Of such cases Aristotle says:
μικταὶ μὲν οὖν εἰσὶν αἱ τοιαῦται πράξεις, ἐοίκασι δὲ μᾶλλον ἑκουσίοις.
Eth. Nic. 3, 1. ‘ Such acts have a mixed character, but if we are
driven to decide we must pronounce them to be Voluntary.' Here
again we find an exact accordance between philosophie speculation
and Roman jurisprudenoe, and, speaking of such cases, the Roman
jurist says with admirable precision, Coactus volui: i.e. It was
under duress, perhaps, but the fact remains that finally the will
assented, and the action must be regarded as Voluntary. Si metu
coactus adii hereditatem, puto me heredem effici, quia, quamvis si
liberum esset noluissem, tamen coactus volui. Sed per praetorem
restituendus sum ut abstinendi mihi potestas tribuatur. D. 4, 2,
21, 5. ‘ If sear compelled me to declare that I accepted a suc-
cession, I really became the successor, because, though in the
absence of danger I should have decliued, yet under duress I have
