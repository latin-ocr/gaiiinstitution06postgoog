16 PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS.

factS, and culpa ignorance or unconsciousnaes of the same factS, are
clearly two states of mind which must always be opposed. No
degree of culpa will pass into doluS. Yet several expressions of the
jurists imply the contrary: e. g. Magnam tamen negligentiam
placuit in doli crimen cadere, Dig. 44, 7, 1, 5. ‘ Gross negligence is
open to the charge of fraudulent intention.' But these statements
only mean that dolus and culpa are often undjstinguishable by a
court of law. The phenomena of gross negligence are precisely
similar to those of dishonest intention, and it is often impossible for
a court to decide which interpretation they ought to bear. Again,
as the consequences are equally mischievous, there is no reason why
they should not be subject to the same legal sanction.

In its signification of deliberate intention Dolus is often used as
an antithesis of violence and a synonym of Fraud. 'Phe reason of
this is obvious· He who can attain his ends by force does not
trouble himself with machinations and artful schemeS. Wiles and
plots, when their object is unlawful, usually imply an absence of
violence and accompany manoeuvres to surprise consent. It isin
this sense that Dolus is defined by Labeo, Labeo sic definit:
dolum malum esse omnem calliditatem, fallaciam, machinationem,
ad circumveniendum, fallendum, decipiendum alterum adhibitam,
Dig. 4, 3, 2. ‘ Labeo defines dolus malus as any craft, imposition,
machination employed to overreach, delude, deceive, another.’
There is, however, no necessary antithesis between deliberate inten-
tion and violence, and we find that the edict, Si cui dolo malo
hominibus coactis damni quid factum esse dicetur, Dig. 47, 8, 2,
‘ Mischief with dolus malus by men assembled is subject to the same
penalty as Rapine,’. uses the term to signify premeditated violence.

'I'here are three principal manifestatione of Dolus, a consciens or
intentional infraction of law: (1) delict, or the violation of a jus
in rem, accompanied or unaccompanied with violence or intimida-
tion, and possibly without any treachery or betrayal of confidence,
e. g. theft or robbery3 mala fides, involving a violation of the
confidenc‘e necessary to social intercourse: and then either (2) the
deliberate violation by a debtor of a jus in personam or obligation
imposed by contract3 in which case Dolus is opposed to Culpa and
Casus: or (3) any unlawful machination or circumvention leading
another person to a manifestation of Will, whether bilateral‚ as a
contract, or unilateral, as a testamentary disposition, or the accept-
ance or disclaimer of a succession, &c. Dolus in this form is often
