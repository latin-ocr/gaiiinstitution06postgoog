proved before a court by the oath of the executor and, unless the
attestation clause is in a certain form, by the affidavit of one of the
subscribing witnesses3 or, if the validity of the will is disputed‚ by
examination of the witnesses on oath in the presence of the parties
interested. The will itself is deposited in the registry of the Court
of Probate3 a copy of it in parchment, under the seal of the Court
of Probate, delivered to the executor along with a certificate of
proof‚ is the only proper evidence of his right to intermeddle with
the personal estate of the testator.

The following were the corresponding formalities of Roman law:—

Tabulae testamenti aperiuntur hoc mod0‚ ut testes vel maxima
pars eorum adhibeatur qui signaverint testamentum3 ita ut, agnitis
signiS, rupto lino, aperiatur et recitetur, atque ita describendi
exempli fiat potestaS, ac deinde signo publico obsignat-um in
archium redigatur, ut si quando exemplum ejus interciderit, sit
unde peti possit.

castelle, conciliabulo facta, in foro vel basilica praesentibus testibus
vel honestis viris inter horam secundam et decimam diei recitari
debebunt, exemploque sublato ab iisdem rursus magistratibus
obsignari quorum praesentia constat aperta.

triduum vel quinque dies aperiendae sunt tabulae3 ab absentibus
quoque intra eos dies cum supervenerint: nec enim oportet tam
heredibus aut legatariis aut libertatibus quam necessario vectigali
moram fieri, Paulus,⁸ Sent. Rec. 4, 6.

‘ A will is opened in the following manner: the witnesseS, or the
majority, who affixed their seaIS, are summoned and acknowledge
their seals‚ the cord is broken, the tablets are opened, the will is
read, a copy is taken, a public seal is affixed to the original, and it
is deposited in the archiveS‚ so that if the copy is ever lost there
may be a means of making another.

‘ In municipalitieS, colonieS, townS, prefectures, wickS, castles,
stapha, a will must be read in the forum or basilica, in the presence
of the attesting witnesses or of respectable personS, between eight
o'clock in the morning and four o’clock in the afternoon3 and, as
soon as a copy has been made, must be sealed up again by the
magistrate in whose presence it was= opened.

‘ A will is intended by the law to be opened immediately after
