debeatur totum in rem patris domi· land or at interest. A fortiori, if
nive versum esse, ad hanc actionem the plaintiff can prove that the
transire debet. nam, ut supra dixi- whole of the debt was converted to
mus, eadem formula et de peculio the uses of the father or master, he
et de in rem verso agitur. should use this action5 for, as I
said above, the same formula lies
both in respect of peculium and of
what has been converted to uses.

ᾧ 71. The term Institor includes a banker (mensae praepositus),
bailiff (agris colendis), foreman (mercaturis), bagman (sed etiam eos
institores dicendos placuit, quibus vestiarii vel lintearii dant vestem
circumferentiam et distrahendam, quos vulgo circitores appellamus,
Dig. 14, 3, 5), and any similar agent, of whatever age or sex (nam
et plerique pueros puellasque tabernis praeponunt, Dig. 14, 3, 8).

The relation of the free captain· (magister) to the shipowner
(exercitor)‚ and of the free manager, overseer, factor (institor) to
his employer (dominus), was the germ or first manifestation of the
general institution of Agency (mandatum), an institution that was
slow in reaching its complete development in Roman jurisprudence.

§74 Actiones adjectitiae qual—itatis, so called because a creditor of x ’
an inferior (slave or son or agent) has against the superior (owner ”
οι· father or principal) an action additional (adjectitia) to that
against the inferior, are six in number: Exercitoria, Institoria, De
peculio, Tributoria, Quod jussu, De in rem verso. When Exerci-
toria and Institoria were brought against the superior or principal, ·
it may be assumed that the Captain or Factor or Agent was named“‘
in the Intentio of the formula and the em ployer or principal in the
Condemnatio, Savigny, System, ξ 54.

The son or slave with a Peculium was like an Institor, except
that his trade or occupation was not, like that of the Institor, de-
fined or prescribed by the superior.

In Tributoria the son or slave traded with the knowledge of his
superior, and therefore resembled still more closely an Institor.
Accordingly in Tributoria no previous deduction of the superior's
claims could be made as in De peculi0. One advantage of Tributoria
was, that all commercia] creditore, including the master of the slave,
were treated on an equal footing, whereas in De peculio the sum due
to the master was deducted before the peculium was computed for
any other creditor. Another advantage was, that commercial
creditore, i. e. creditore in respect of the particular trade in which
the son or slave was engaged, had an exclusive right to satisfaction
