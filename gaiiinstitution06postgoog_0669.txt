reproducing at will natural detention.’ There was an exception in
the case of slaves, for a fugitive slave was regarded as still in his
master's possession, and in the case of land, for a man did not lose
possession of his land which had been invaded in his absence until
he had notice of the invasion3 that is to say, he retained possession
in the interim solely ΒΥ his mental disposition. Nam saltus
hibernos et aestivOS, quorum possessio retinetur anim0, licet neque
servum neque colonum ibi habeamuS, quamvis saltus proposito pos·
sidendi fuerit alius ingressus, tamdiu priorem possidere dictum est,
quamdiu possessionem ab alio occupatam ignoraret, Dig. 41, 2, 44.
‘ When a winter or summer pasture, retained in possession without
the instrumentality of slaves or tenantS, solely by the mental rela-
tion, is invaded ΒΥ a stranger, the prior possessor is not regarded
as ousted from possession until he has notice of the invasion? It
is by reference to this laxer interpretation and to these exceptions
that we can understand the statement of Gaim, ᾧ 153, that posses-
sion may be retained without a continuance of corporeal detention.

A guardian acting alone may acquire possession for an infant
ward, that is, a child under the age of seven. Or possession may be
acquired by Prehension on the part of the infant, while the Animus
domini is supplied by tutoris auctoritas„ Dig. 41, 2, 32, 2. This is
exceptional‚ because in other matters tutoris auctoritas could only
be given to a child infantia major, i. e. after completion of seven
years of age. After seven years complete a child can acquire
possession for itself either with or without the guardian’s authority,
3 ᾧ 109; Dig. 26, 8, 9 pr.

The possessor of a whole or a substance formed by the com-

bination of various parts (universitas) does not separately possess
with intention of ownership the various elements of which it is

composed. If, then, a man begins by possessing the whole and
completes the usucapion of the whole before its dissolution into its

component parta, the result will depend on the question whether
all the parts belonged to the original proprietor of the whole or
some of them belonged to a third person. If some of the materials
belonged to a third proprietor, then, as these have not been se-
parately possessed during the period of combination, the usucapion
of them only begins to run after the dissolution of the whole,
Dig. 6, 1, 23, 7 ; Dig. 41, 1, 7, 11. This rule is not a singularity of
timber (Dig. 47, 3), but applies to all materials that have been com-
bined into a whole, whether movable or immovable.
