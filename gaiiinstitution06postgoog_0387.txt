establish one.

The thing to be restored by the borrower in a loan for con-
sumption was not the specific thing that was bon-owed, but some
other thing of the same genus, Such ,members of a genus as are
naturally capable of mutual substitution (quae vice mutua fungun-
tur) received from modern civilians the barbarous name of res
fungibiles. A more significant barbarism, if any was necessary,
would have been res vicariae, from the principal word of the

Connected with the contract of mutuum was the senatuscon-

parricide, according to some commentators, after a money-lenden
This decree passed, according to Tacitus, under Claudius (Annales,
11, 13), according to Suetonius, under Vespasian (Suet. Vesp. 11),
prohibited lending money to a person under power (filiusfamilias)
without the consent of the father. Verba senatusconsulti Mace-
doniani haec sunt: Quum inter ceteras sceleris causas Macedo quas
