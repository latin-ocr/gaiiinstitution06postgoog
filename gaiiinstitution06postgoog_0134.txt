DE PERSONIS.

[1. ξς 132-136.

§133. A grandfather who has
both a son, and by his son a grand·
son, in his power, may either release
his son from his power and retain
the grandson, or retain the son and
manumit the grandson, or emanet,
pate both son and grandson 3 and a
great grandfather has a similar lati·
tude of choice.

ᾗ 134. Α father is also divested
of power over his children by giving
them in adoption. To give a son
in adoption, the first stage is three
mancipatione and two manumissione,
as in emanet patlon aster thia the
son is either remancipated ιο the
father, and by the adopter claimed
as son from him by vindication be-
fore the praetor, and in default of
counterclaim by the natural father
is awarded by the praetor to the
adoptive father as his son; or without
remancipation tc the natural father
is directly claimed by the adoptive
father by vindication from the
alienee of the third mancipation
(fiduciary father); but it is more
convenient to inter-pose a remanci-
pation ιο the natural father. In the
case of other issue, male or female,
a single mancipation suffices, with
or without remancipation to the
natural father. In the provinces a
similar ceremony can be performed

before the president of the pro-

vmce.

ξ 135 α. A grandson begotten
after the first or second mancipa-
tion of the son, though born after
the third mancipation, is sub-
ject ιο the power of the grand-
father, and may by him be given in
adoption or emancipated: a grand·
son begotten after the third manci-
pation is not born in the power of
the grandfather, but, according ιο
Labeo, is born' m mancipation ιο the
person to whom his father ιε manci·
pated. The rule, however, which
has obtained acceptance is, that so
