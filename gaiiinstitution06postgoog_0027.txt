PRELIMINARY DEFIN ITION S. 5

nnimpeaehed. The corresponding Sanctioning rights, or rights
of the injured party to redi-ess, are the right of the dispossessed
proprietor to be reinstated in possession, the right of the deceived
contractor to have damages for non-performance or to have specific
performance enforced by the court, the right of the slandered
person to recover damages for slander.

'I'he divergence of Rights into two classes, rights antecedent to
wrong, and rights consequent on wrong, which we have referred to
a divergence of mles, flows immediately from the essenee of Law,
and may be dedueed from its definition.

The essenee of every Law is the injunction or prohibition of some
given act and the menace of an evil in the case of non-compliance.
Every law, that is to say, is at once Imperative and Punitory 3
it is only Imperative by being Punitory. So far as law is Impera-
tive, it confers primary or sanctioned rights, and imposes primary
or sanctioned duties3 so far as it is Punitory, it confers secondary
or sanctioning rights, and imposes secondary or sanctioning duties.
A primary obligation may be defined as the burden imposed by the
law in its first or imperative clause 3 a secondary obligation as the
burden imposed by the law in its alternative or punitory clause.

Sanctioning rights only exist for the, sake of Sanctioned rights.
Accordingly, the latter may be called principal or final, the former
instrumental or ancillary. So far as the existence of Sanctioned
rights is dependent on the existence of Sanctioning rights, we
might invert the epithets primary and secondary, which we have
applied to them. I have no Sanctioned rights independently
of the inj unction or prohibition which declares that some act or
omission is a. violation of my right, and vindicates it by a Sanc-
tion civil or criminal. That is, my Sanctioned right or duty owes
its existence to the injunction or prohibition of certain acts and
to the remedy or punishment to be applied in case of disobedienee.
Accordingly, though looking at them as means and ends, we have
mlled Sanctioning rights Secondary and Sanctioned rights Primary 3
yet if we looked at the order of existence, we might call Sanctioning
rights Primary and Sanctioned rights Secondary.

Again, Sanctioning rights and duties are directly enforeed by
the courts, Sanctioned rights and duties only indirectly. Sanc-
tioning rights and duties are not only immediately enforced, but
also universally and invariablyâ€š except when there is a miscarriage
of justice. Sanctioned rights and duties cannot be secured from
