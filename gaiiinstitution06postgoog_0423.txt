correal debtors, had no regressus against his co-fidejussors, Dig.
46, 1, 39.

Correality is again instanced in the sponsors and Fidepromissors
of the provinces external to Italy under the operation of the lex
Apuleia.. Unlike other correal debtors they had by this statute
Regressus by means of the action pro Soci0, ξ 122; though like
Fidej ussors, they also had Beneficium divisionis under the con-
stitution of Hadrian, § 121.

5. Solidary Intercession is exemplified by the Mandator in the
contract called MANDATUM QUALIHCATUM. Here a lender gives eredit
to a. borrower in reliance on the representations of the mandator,
ᾦ 156, who thus is 8 guarantor of the borrower's solvency: when
there are several sueh guarantors‚ their liability is solidary.

6. Other Solidary Intercessors are the constituentes in cou-
s‘rrru‘mu DEBITI ALIENI. Both the Mandator and the constituens
have Beneficium divisionis, Cod. 4, 18, 3, and Beneficium excussionis,
Novella 4.

ξ 114. The peculiarity of the rules respecting the adstipulator
81136 from the fact that he was a mandatam, agent, or trustes, the
repositary of a special personal confidence. Hence his rights did
not pass to his heres nor to his paterfamilias. Ordinary 111163,
however, obtained so far, that he could not sue so long as he

remained a filiusfamilias, nor after his rights had been extinguished '·· ‚ ··

The principal function of the Adstipulator and one function of ⁸ . Η

the Adpromissor (the chief function of the latter of course was
suretyship) seems to have been processual agency, i. e. the repre-
sentation of the principal as plaintiff or defendant in a suit at a
period when the doctrine of Agency was still undeveloped.

We must suppose a time when the Cognitor and Procurator,
whose appointment as described, 4 ξ 83, was such a simple
matter, were institutions not yet invented: 8 period like that of
statute-process (legis actio), concerning which we are told: Nemo
alieno nomine lege agere potest, Dig. 50, 17, 123, ‘ only principale
could be parties to a suit 3 ' and when, nevertheless, circumstances
often prevented a principal from litigating in person. In questions
of Property 116 might get over the difficulty and practically employ
an agent by fiduciary mancipation, Dig. 4, 7, 4, 3, of the property in
dispute to 8 third person, who would then litigate with the adver-
