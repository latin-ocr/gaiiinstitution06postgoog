presence of the magistrate (in jure cessio). In a liberalis causa the
slave to be manumitted, being the subject of the fictitious litigation,
could not himself be a party, but was advocated by a vindex or
adsertor libertatis, who in later times was usually represented by
the praetor’s lictor. 'I'he adsertor grasping the slave with one of
his hands, and touching him with the vindicta, asserted his freedom,
4 ᾧ 16. The proprietor quitting his grasp of the slave (manu
mittens) and confessing by silence or express declaration the justice
of the claim, the magistrate pronounced the slave to be free. This
procedure belonging to the praetor’s voluntary, not his contentious,
jurisdiction, did not require the praetor to be seated on his elevated
platform in the comitium (pro tribunali), but might be transacted
by him on the level ground (de plano); and as the mere presence of
the praetor constituted a court (jus), he was usually seized upon for
the purpose of manumissions as he was preparing to take a drive
(gestatio), or to bathe, or to go to the theatre.

ᾧ 18. The lex Aelia Sentia passed in the reign of Augustus, in
the same year with the lex J ulia de maritandis ordinibus, Aa). 4,
and named after the consuls Sextus Aelius Catus and Caius Sentius
Saturninus, was intended to throw obstacles in the way of acquiring
the Roman franchise. One of its enactments provided that a slave
under the age of thirty could not be made a citizen unless manu-
mitted by Vindicta, after proof of adequate motive before a certain
judicial board. We may inquire what would be the effect of manu-
mission if the causae probatio were omitted. Inscription on the
censor's register was probably entirely null and void, as this cere-
mony was either a mode of making a Roman citizen or it was
nothing. Testamentary manumission, as we learn from Ulpian,
left the man legally a slave, but gave him actual liberty (possessio
libertatis, in libertate esse, as opposed to libertas), a condition
recognized and protected by the praetor. Manumission by Vin-
dicta probably gave the slave freedom without the franchise, i. e.
made him a peregrinus3 at least it is not obvious why he should
have been worse off than testamento manumissus, and the following
passage of Ulpian implies that their condition was not exactly the
same: ‘ Eadem lege cautum est ut minor triginta annorum servus
vindicta manumissus civis Romanus non fiat, nisi apud consilium
causa probata fuerit, id est sine consilio manumissum caeseris ’ (sic.
For this word some conjecture: Lex Aelia Sentia. Perhaps we
should read something to the following effect: peregrinum facit,
