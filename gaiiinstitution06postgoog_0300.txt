hereditatis ex eo testamento heredes capiant. Eis quibus quid ita
datum legatumve erit, eam pecuniam sine fraude sua capere liceto,
isque heres qui eam pecuniam dare jussus damnatus erit, eam pecu-
niam debeto dare quam damnatus est, Dig. 35, 2, l, pr. ‘ Every
Roman citizen who, after this law passes, makes a will, is entitled
and empowered to give and bequeath whatever money to whatever
citizen of Rome he desires in accordance with the laws of Rome,
provided that such bequest leave at least one fourth of the inherit-
ance to be taken under that will by the heirs. Such bequests the
legatees are permitoed to accept without penalty (an allusion to the
penalty of the lex Furia), and the heir there-with charged is bound
to pay?

'I'he words limiting the operation of the lex Falcidia to wills
executed aster the date of its enactment take this law out of the
general mle respecffing the temporal limita of the application of
laws in the event of legislative innovations. The general rule for
determining, ο11 any change of the law, whether a given right is to
be governed by the older or the newer law, is the principle that a
new law has no retroactive influence on vested rights (acquired
rights), but governs all that have yet to vest. Now under a will no
one has vested rights, whatever his expectations, before the death of
the testator. This date fixes the overture of the succession (vocatio
heredis, delatio hereditatis), the vesting of the rights of the successor
and also of the legatee (legatofflm dies cedens, ᾗ 244), and deter-
mines the law by which they are governed. By the general rule,
then, the lex Falcidia would have applied to all wills whose testatore
died after its enactment, at whatever date they were executed.
'I'he legislator wished to disarm the opposition of those who had
made their wills by excepting them from its operation3 though in
many cases the lex Falcidia would be less rigorous thanthe lex ⁶
and lex Voconia, which it superseded‚ and ‘testatore woffifl* be ad
to revise their testamentary dispositions. Savigny, System, ᾗ 394.
