ᾗ 197. Senatusconsulto Neroniano cautum est ut quod minus
pactis (aptis Ρ) verbis legatum est perinde sit acsi optimo jure
legatum esset: opt-imum autem jus legati per damnationem est,
Ulpian, 24, 11. ‘ The senatusconsult of Nero provided that every
inaptly worded bequest should be deemed to be expressed in the
most favourable form: the most favourable form being by eon-
demnation.’

By this senatusconsult, Am. 64, the four forms of legacy are not
entirely abolished, but the importance of their distinctions is very

Three years afterwards, a constitution of Constantius and Con-
stans abolished all legal formulas in the following terms: Juris
formulae, aucupatione syllabarum insidiantes, cunctorum actibus
penitus amputentur, Cod. 2, 58, 1. ‘ Legal formulas, with suares

Finally, J ustinian enaeted ut omnibus legatis una sit natura,
Inst. 2, 20, 2, that all bequests should be of one nature; and
