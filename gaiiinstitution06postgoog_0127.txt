DE MANOIPIO.

105

Dr. menno,

§ 116. Superest ut exponamus
quae personae in mancipio sint.

ξ 117. Omnes igitur liberorum
personae, sive masculini sive femi-
nini sexus, quoe in potestate paren-
tis sunt, mancipari ab hoc eodem
modo possunt, quo etiam servi man-
cipari possunt.

§ 118. Idem iuris est in earum
personis quae in manu sunt. nam
feminae a coemptionatoribus eodem
modo possunt mancipari quo liberi
a parente mancipantur ,· adeo qui·
dem, ut quamvis ea sola aput co-
emptionatorem filiae loco sit quae
ei nupta sit, tamen nihilo minus
etiam quae ei nupta non sic, nec ob
id filiae loco sit, ab eo mancipari
possit.

ξ 118 a. Plerumque solum et a
parentibus et a coemptionatoribus
mancipantur, cum velint parentes
coemptionatoresque e suo iure eas
personas dimittere, sicut inferius
evidentius apparebit.

ξ 119. Est autem mancipatiO, ut
supra quoque diximus, imaginaria
quaedam venditio: quod et ipsum ius
proprium civium Romanorum est.
eaque res ita agitur. adhibitis non
minus quam quinque testibus civi·
bus Romanis puberibus, et prae-
terea alio eiusdem condicionis qui
libram aeneam teneat, qui appella-
tur libripens, is qui mancipio acci-
pit rem, aes tenens ita dicit: Hunc

deinde aere percutit libram, idque
aes dat ei a quo mancipio accipit,
quasi pretii loco.

,ξ 116. It remains to examine
what it is to be held in mancipation.

ξ 117. All children, male or fe-
male, in the power of their father
are liable to be mancipated by their
father just as his slaves may be
mancipated.

5118. Α woman in the hand
is subject to the same mode of
alienation, and may be mancipated
by the person who has acquired her
by coemption just as a child may.
be mancipated by its father: and
although the acquirer by coemptioni
has not the power of a father over
her unless he is her husband, never·
theless, even when he is not her
husband, and therefore has not the
status of a father, he cau dispose of
her by mancipation.

ξ 118 α. Almost the sole occasion
of mancipation by a parent or ae·
quirer by coemption is when the
parent or acquiret by coemption
daeigns to liberate the person man·
ciplzlited fforpl hig lawful cofsltlrol, as
w presen y e more y ex-
plained.

ξ 119. Mancipation, as before
stated, is an imaginary sale which
is only within the competence of
Roman citizens, and consiste in the
following process: in the presence
of not fewer than five witnesses,
citizens of Rome above the age of
puberty, and another person of the
same condition, who holds a bronze
balance in his hands and is called
the balance holder, the alienee hold·
ing a bronze ingot in his hand, pro-
nounces the following words: THIS

mr mena* QUmITARY Am) nn Im

nnonzn. He then strikes the scale
with the ingot, which he delivers to
