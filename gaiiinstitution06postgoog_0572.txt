550 DE ACTIONIBUS.

[lv. ἕξ 69-74.

Α defendant was allowed to deduct his cross demand or inde-
pendent debt from the demand of the plaintiff by the English
courts of Equity‚ but not by the courts of Common law, until the

Statutes 2 Geo, 11, c. 223 8 Ge0. 11, 6. 24, introduced the plea of
set-off into the courts of Common law.

peculium filiorumfamilias servorum-

ξ 70. Inprimis itaque si iussu
patris dominive negotium gestum
erit, in solidum Praetor actionem
in patrem dominumve conparavit:
et recte, quia qui ita negotium gerit
magis patris dominive quam filii

ξ 71. Eadem ratione comparavit
duas alias actiones, exercitoriam et
institoriam. tunc autem exercitoria

quia exercitor vocatur is ad quem

ξ 69. Α6 we have mentioned the
action in respect of Peculium, we
must explain this action and the
others by which fathers and masters
are sued for the debts of their sons
or slaves.

ξ 70. Firstly, if it was at the bid-
ding of the father or master that
the plaintiff contracted with the son
01· slave, the father or master may
be sued for the whole amount, for
then the contract was made 111
reliance on the credit of the father
or master rather than of the son or
slave.

ἦ 71. 011 the same principle the
praetor granta two other actions,
one to recover the debt of a ship-
captain, the other to recover the
debt of 6 manager or factor. The
actio exercitoria lies against a father
or master who has appointed 6 6011
or slave to be captain of 6 ship, to
recover a debt incur-red by the 6011
or slave 111 his character of captain.
As such 6 contract is made with
the consent of the father or master
heis justly liable for the whole. So
if 6 111611 appoint another person's
slave or 6 freeman to be captain, he
may be sued by the praetorian
action. The action is called Exer-
citoria because the shipowner or
charterer who appoints the captain
is called Exercitor. The actio In-
stitoria 1166 against a man who
appoints his son or slave or another
person's slave or 6 freeman to man-
