DE PERSONIS.

[1. ἕξ 124-131.

ξ 129. Though the hostile capture
of the parent makes him a slave of
the enemy, the status of his children
is suspended by his right of retro-

from captivity a man recovers all
former rights : accordingly, if the
father returns he will have his chil-
dren in his power 3 if he dies in
captivity his children will be inde·
pendent, but whether their inde·
pendence dates from the death of
the parent or from his capture by
the enemy may be disputed. Con-
versely, if a son or grandson is cap-
tured by the enemy, his right of
subsequent recovery of status causes
the power of his ascendent to be
provisionally suspended.

ξ 130. Further, a son is liberated
from parental power by his inaugu-
ration as flamen of Jove, a daughter
by her selection for the office of
Vestal virgin.

§ 131. Formerly, too, when Rome
used to send colonies into the Intin
territory, an order of the parent to
depart for a Intin colony was held
to liberate a son from parental

foreign state.

ᾧ 128. Relegation was a milder form of punishment than de·
portation‚ and involved no loss of civitas nor of domestic rights,

Inst. 1, 12, 2.

ξ 129. Postliminium is the recovery of rights by a person re-

turned from captivity, or the recovery of rights over a person or
thing recovered from hostile possession. The word postliminium
seems to be derived from pot, the root of potestas or possessi0‚ and
limen or stlimen= ligamen, and therefore would denote the bridging
over of the interval of captivity by a fiction of continued capacity or
possession, as a doorway is bridged over by a lintel (limen).

ᾧ 130. In imitation of the ancient law J ustinian enacted that
certain dignities should release from patria potestas3 for instance,

patriciatus and the episcopate, the latter because it made a man
spiritual father of all mankind, Novella, 81.
