cipable and things not mancipable, would have become obsolete.
We find it, however, still treated as an important remedy in J us-
tinian’s legislation. The reason is, that this remedy was not only
applicable to the alienation by tradition of a mancipable thing, the
application we have hitherto considered, but to the alienation of
anything whatever by a non-proprietor to an innocent alienee.
Usucapion, as in the former case, would in the lapse of time have
given the alienee plenary dominion‚ and, with it, vindication in the
event of a loss of possession 3 but if he lost possession whilst usu-
capion was still incomplete, he would have had no remedy (for,
not being owner, he could not vindicate), if the praetor had not
allowed him to sue by the actio Publiciana, which treated bona fide
possession, that is, usucapion possession, or the inception of usu-
capion‚ as if it were plenary dominion. In the Digest this circum·
stance is mentioned as the sole ground on which Publiciana was
maintainable, as indeed it was, after the abolition of mancipation.
Si quis id quod traditur (we should probably read, Si quis quid
traditum) ex justa causa non a dominc, et nondum usucaptum petet,
judicium dabo, Dig. 6, 2, pr. ‘ On delivery for a just consideration
by a non-proprietor, and before usucapion, the alienes shall have an
action to recover possession.' In the intentio of this action the
plaintiff set out the conti-act or other justa causa which preceded
tradition, 4 ᾧ 36, whereaS‚ in an ordinary vindication, he merely
asserted his ownership in general terms. See, however, 4 §16‚ com.
as to expressio causae, and 4 ᾧ 109, com. as to causa adjecta.

to accept or reject the snccession, or necessarius, designated without
any such power of election. Heres voluntarius was either an
agnate entitled to succeed an intestate‚ or any devisee‚ not being a
child of the testator, entitled under a will. Heres necessarius was
either a manumitted slave, or a sels-successor (suus heres), that is, a
child under power of the testator or intestate, ᾧ 152. In every
case but that of the suus heres, so long as the heir had not taken
possession, any sti-anger was permitted to seize parts of the inherit-
ance and acquire property therein by usucapion. The only title
(causa, titulus) required for this acquisition was the overture or
