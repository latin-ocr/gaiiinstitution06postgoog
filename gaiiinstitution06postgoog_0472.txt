450 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [111. ξιξ 168-181.

of title, certain minor conditions of judgment in his favour which
agree in the common character that, in the formulary period, they
were not expressed, as conditions of the judgment, in the intentio
of the formula. E.g. in vindicatio the possession of the subject
by the defendant, although it commences after litis contestatiO,
suffices to render him liable to be condemned. So in the actio de
peculio, the existence of a peculium3 in the actio mandati, the
existence of moneys belonging to the principal in the hands of the
agent3 in the actio pigneraticia, the satisfaction of the debt by the
mortgagor3 all respectively conditions of a J udgment in favour of
the plaintiff, render the defendant liable to condemnatio even when
they are events subsequent to the institution of the suit.

The same applies to certain exceptions: in the exceptio divisionis
the question respecting the solvency of co-debtors, p. 402,·and in
the beneficium competentiae, the question respecting the means of
the defendant, p. 350, is decided according to the circumstances in
existence at the moment of condemnatio.

3. Litis contestatio has hitherto been considered in respect of its
influence on the Conservation or Destruction of a ground of action.
We proceed to its‚‚effect on the Amount of the condemnation.

(a) 'Po save the plaintiff from being injured bv the unavoidable
duration of the suit, without, however, deterring the defendant from
the defence of what he honestly believes to be his rights; a J udg·
ment against the defendant requires him to restore Omnis Causa, i.e.
omne quod habiturus esset actor, si statim judicii accepti tempore

= res ei reddita fuisset, Dig. 6, 1, 20, 311 that the plaintiff would have

had if the thing had been restored at the moment of litis contestatiO.
This implies the restitution of FructuS, all the gain of whatever
nature that the defendant has derived from the fact of possession.
g If the object claimed is a sum of money, the defendant, notwith-

ἶ standing the absence of mora,·must pay Interest from the date of

litis contestatio.

(b) After litis contestatio the defendant, the bona fide possessor
as well as the mala fide possessor, the debtor free from mora as well
as the debtor chargeable with mora, is liable for Culpa of every
kind and degree, and responsible for the destruction and deteriora·
tion thereby occasioned. E. g. he is liable for neglected fruita
(fructus percipiendi) as well as for fructus consumpti and fructus

extantes, for the OQJPE-Q-⁰21„lff,t jhe fruits is a piece of culpable
supineness.
