’860 ’ΒΕ OBLIGATIONIBUS. [111. ἕξ 88, 89.

These two typical 8188888, however, fail to comprehend all the
obligations enforceable by 881108, 88(1 two supplementary classes
have to be added: (3) obligations similar to those founded on con-
tract3 and (4) obligations similar to those founded on delict.

A Contract is 8 convention or agreement (conventio, pactiO,
pactum) enforceable by appeal to a court of judicature. Et est pactio
duorum pluriumve in idem placitum consensus, Dig. 2, 14, 1, 2.
‘ A convention is the consent of two or more parties that a party
shall do or not do some particular thing.'

Consensus, the 8888888 of convention, will be found on close
examination to consist not, as might at first sight appear, of two
precisely similar elements contributed by the two consenting parties,
but of two dissimilar clemente, an intention signified by 8 promisor,
and 8 corresponding expectation signified by a promisee. 'I'he pro-
misor promises that he will do or perform some given 881 01 acts,
or that 118 will forbear 01 abstain from 80188 given 881 or acts 3 that
is, he signifies to the promisee that he intends to do the acts or to
observe the forbearances which form 1118 object of his promise: and
the promisee ac'cepts the promise3 that is, signifies 10 1118 promisor
his belief or expectation that the latter will (10 01 forbear agreeably
10 the intention which he has expressed. Every convention‚ then,
consiste of 8 promise proffered and accepted3 that 18, (1) of 8 signi-
fication by the promising party of his intention to do the acts or 10
observe the forbearanoes which he promises to (10 01 observe, and
(2) a signification by the promisee that he expects that the promis-
ing party *will fulfil the proffered promise. Without signification
of the intention there is no promise3 without signification of the
expectation there is no reason for enforcing the promise. The
consensus of the parties is the chiming or going together of this
intention -with this expectation ; their direction to a common
object, the acts or forbearances contemplated by the convention.
Ponioitafion is the offer of the one party before it is accepted by
the other. Pactum est duorum consensus atque conventio; pollici-
tatio vcro offerentis solius promissum, Dig. 50, 12, 3.
