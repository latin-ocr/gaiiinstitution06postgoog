is bound to discharge the whole object of the passive obligation:
but differ in this, that whereas Correality implies the unity or
identity of the obligation by which the eo-creditors are entitled or
the co-debtors are bound} Solidarity implies that they are entitled
or bound by a plurality or diversity of obligations.

Solidarity orig-instes in various modes:

(a) Common delict, when several oo-delinquents incur a liability
to indemnifieation.

(b) Co-guardianship‚ when one of the co-guardians has injured
the ward from neglig-enee.

(c) Contract in which there are several promisors but no pactum
adjectum to create Correality3 e. g. where there are several
borrowers, hirers, agents, depositariae.

(d) Guaranty by the form of mandate called Mandatum qualifi-
catum3 or by the form of Constitutum called constitutum debiti
alieni.

Both Correality and Solidarity, as implying an integral but
alternative obligation, lie in the mean between two extremes: on
the one side, divided or partial (pro rata) liability3 and on the other
side, the multiple or cumulative liability, generated by delicts that
give rise to bilaterally penal suits (4 ξ 6). Ε. g. if several persons·
combine to commit a theft they are all severally debtors for the
whole penalty, and payment by one does not discharge his fellows;
or if a person is guilty of an outrage (injuria) which wounds the
honour of several, they are all creditors for the penalty, and re-
covery by one does not extinguish the claims of the rest, 3 ξ 221.
‘Where the actions on delict are purely indemnificatory, or only
unilaterally penal, as the actions brought on Metus, DoluS, Noxa,
Vis, there, as we have already stated, the relation of Solidarity
subsiste between the co-delinquents, and satisfaction by one ex-
tinguishes the obligation of the rest.

'Phe differences between Correality and Solidarity are principally
two:

1. In Correality the right of aetion against the remaining eo-
debtors or by the remaining co·creditors was extinguished by the
institution of a suit (litis contestatio) against or by one, whatever
the result of the suit: in Solidarity the right of action was only
extinguished by complete payment or satisfaction (solutio). Electo
reo principali fidejussor vel heres ejus liberatur: non idem in
mandatoribus observatur, Paulus 2, 17, 16. ‘ Election to sue the
