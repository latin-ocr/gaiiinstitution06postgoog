conparandum: quae pecunia (lice-

ξ 28. Lege autem introducta est
pignoris capio velut lege ΧΠ tabu·

adversus eum qui mercedem non
redderet pro eo iumento quod quis

§ 29. Ex omnibus autem istis
causis certis verbis pignus capieba-

PIGNORIS CAPIO.

money to buy barley for his horse
called aes hordearium.

ξ 28. The law of the Twelve
Tables rendered liable to distress
on default of payment the buyer of
a victim and the hirer of a beast of
burden lent to raise money for a
sacrifice. The lex praediatoria gave
the power of distress to the sarmers
of the public revenue.

§29. As in all these cases the
distreinor used a set form of words,
the proceeding was generally con-
sidered a form of statute process.
Some, however, held otherwise,
because it was performed in the
absence of the praetor and generally
of the debtor; whercaS, the other
forms of statute process could only
be enacted in the presence of the
praetor and the adversar-y 3 besideS,
it could take place in the juridical
vacation (2 § 279), that is, in days
unavailable for statute process.

Distress in English law bears a certain resemblance to Execution.

Each is the application of constraint to a defendant’s will by seizure
of his goods. But making a distress is the aet of a private person,
and precedes the commencement of an action: execution follows
after judgment obtained in an action, and is the act of the executive
at the command of the sovereign. The pignoris capio of the older
Roman law corresponded to distress3 the pignoris captio of the
formulary system generally was a mode of execution.

Perhaps pignoris capi0‚ like manus injectiO, was originally an act
of Self-redress, and did not amount to legis actio unless it led to a
suit in which the distreinor was plaintiff.
