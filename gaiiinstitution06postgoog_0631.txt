ᾧ 117. Intimidation (813335) 1180 ground to support not only
an exception, but also 811 action and an in integrum restitutio.

'I'he words of the edict. Quod metus 081108 gestum erit ratum non
habeb0, Dig. 4, 2, 1,‘ Duress shall be a ground for rescinding any
disposition,' are in rem scripta or impersonal: they do not specify
the intimidator‚ but promise a remedy even against innocent
persons who may have come into possession of property in con-
sequence of an intimidation. Τ110 actio quod metus causa was
an actio arbitraria, ᾧ 47, and during one year was bilaterally

simple damages and was purely conservative or restorative. It
was 8 personal action, and therefore in case of the defendant's in-
solvency 1180 not 88 adequate remedy, 80 the plaintiff then would
only share the assets with the other creditore of the defendant.
To enable the plaintiff to bring a real action it would 110 necessary

then might bring a vindicatio, which would separate 1110 property
from the assets of the defendant over which other creditors had

arbitraria and 111 integrum restitutio. The action quod dolo malo
factum est, if brought to recover the whole amount of loss
incurred by fraud, being unilaterally penal, 01 penal in respect of
the defendant, originally was prescribed in 8 year. Constantine,
ΛΔ). 319, extended the period of prescription to two calendar
yeme, biennium continuum, Cod. 2, 22, 8. After that period the
plaintiff had only a non-penal actio in factum for damages to the
amount that the defendant had gained by the fraud.

that the right of the plaintiff was vitiated in its origin: the words:
neque fiat, allege dolus praesens, i. e. assert that the right of the
plaintiff, though originally clear of (101110, 10 now in collision with
a right of the defendant, e. g. compensatio. Dolo facit quicunque
