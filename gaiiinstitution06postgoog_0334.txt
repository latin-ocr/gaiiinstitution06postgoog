§ 14. Quod ad feminas tamen
attinet, in hoc iure aliud in ipsa·
rum hereditatibus capiendis placuit,
aliud in ceterorum bonis ab his
capiendis. nam feminarum heredi-
tates perinde ad nos aquationis iure
redeunt atque masculorum z nostrae
vero hereditates ad feminas ultra
consanguineorum gradum non per-
tinent. itaque soror fratri sororive
legitima heres est; amita vero et
fratris filia legitima heres esse ποπ
potest. sororis autem nobis loco est
etiam mater aut noverca quae per in
manum conventionem aput patrem
nostrum iura filiae consecuta est.

ἔ 15. Si ei qui defunctus erit sit
frater et alterius fratris filius, sicut
ex superioribus intellegitur, frater
prior est, quia gradu praecedit. sed
alia facta est iuris interpretatio
inter suos heredes.

ξ 16. Quodsi defuncti nullus fra-
ter extet, sed sint liberi fratrum, ad
omnes quidem hereditas pertinet:
sed quaesitum est, si dispari forte
numero sint nati, ut ex uuo unus
vel duo, ex altero tres vel quattuor,

tamen placuit in capita dividendam
esse hereditatem. itaque quotquot

there will be no testamentary suc-

ξ 14. As to females, the rules of
title by deseent are not the same in
respect of the successione which

successions which they take.
inheritanee left by a female is ac-
quired by a male by the same title
of agnation as an inheritance left
by a male, but an inheritance left
by a male does not devolve to fe-
males beyond sisters born of the
same father. Thus a sister succeeds
to a sister or brother by the same
father, but the sister of a father and
daughter of a brother have no sta-
tutory title by descent. The rights
of quasi sister belong to a mother
or stepmother who pasees into the
hand of a father by marriage and
acquires the position of a quasi
daughter.

brother and another brother’ s son,

the rule app ed to self· -suecessors

ξ 16. If the deceased leaves no
brother, but children of more than
one brother, they are all entitled to
the succession3 and it was once a
question, in case the brothers left
an unequal number of children,
whether the number of stems was
to be the divisor of the inheritanoe,
as among sels-successore, or the
number of individuale ; however, it
has long been settled that the di-
visor is the number of individuals.
Accordingly, the total number of
persons determines the number of
parts into which the inheritance
must be divided, and each indivi-
dual takes an equal portion.
