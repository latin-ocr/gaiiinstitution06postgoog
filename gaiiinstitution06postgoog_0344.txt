under J ustinian any signification of intention to accept the suc-
cession was sufficient without a demand. The interval allowed
for this signification of intention (agnitio) to a parent or child
of the defunct was a year, to other claimants a hundred days.
If a person in a superior order or degree omitted to signify his
acceptance in the interval allowed, the succession then devolved
to the next order or degree. If the person who thus omitted to
signify acceptance had only a praetorian title to the successim, his
right was entirely forfeited by the omission3 but if he was entitled
at civil law he could evict the bonorum possessor, who accord-
ingly was said to have only a nugatory or ineffective possession
(sine re).

§38. We have already seen that the devisee under an un·
authorized will of a female, though he obtained juxta-tabular pos·
sessim, might be evicted by the person entitled as agnete, 2 ξ 119,
and that a devisee under a praetorian will might be evicted by a
devisee under a prior civil will or by a person entitled as agnate,
unless the sole informality of the praetorian will, which rendered it

invalid as a civil will, was the omission of mancipation or nuncu-
pation‚ 2 ξ 149.

patronum suum in testamento prae-

patrono iuris erat. et si quidem ex

esse querella3 si vero vel adoptivus
filius filiave, vel uxor quae in manu

§ 40. Freedmen were originally
allowed to pass over their patron
in their testamentary dispositions.
By the law of the Twelve Tables
the inheritance of a freedman only
devolved on his patron when he
died intestate and without leaving
a sels-successor. If he died intes-
tate but left a sels-successor, the
patron was excluded‚ and if the
sels-successor was a natural child,
this was no grievance3 but if the
sels-successor was an adoptive child
or a wife in the hand, it was hard
that they should bar all claim of the

atron.

period, the praetor's edict corrected
this injustice of the law, If a fi-eed-
