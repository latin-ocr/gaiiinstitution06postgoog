DE RERUM UNIVERSITATIBUS. [111. ξς 85-87.

Thus it extinguished any ususfructus or usus vested in the arrogatus.
This effect was abrogated by J ustinian.

(ιῖ) It extinguished debts owed by the arrogatus. As a filius-
familias was just as capable at civil law of incurring debts as a
paterfamilias, it is hard to say why the passage from one condition to
the other should operate an extinction of debt. This effect, as we
see, was counteracted by the quasi legislative action of the praetor.

Arrogatio in the legislation of J ustinian ceased to operate a

transfer of the universitas juris.

It only conveyed to the arro-

gator a life estate (ususfructus) in the property of the arrogatuS.
The reversion or fee (dominium) remained in the arrogatae, Inst.

Coemptio is not noticed by J ustinian, as the in manum conventio
of the wife was obsolete long before his time.

§ 85. If a person entitled to suc·
ceed as agnato to an intestate, before
declat-ing his acceptanoe or acting
as heir, surrender the inheritance in
a fictitious vindication, the plenary
right of succession pasees to the
surrenderee exactly as if he were
entitled by agnation. If the agnate
first accepts and then surrenders,
be continues heir, and is liable to
the creditore for the debts of the
deceased: the corpor-eal subjecta of
the inheritance pass just as if they

charged of liability.

ξ 86. The same happens when a
devisee accepts and then surrenders,
but before aceeptance his sur-render
is inoperative.

ξ 87. Whether a sels-successor or
a necessary successor pasees the suc-
cession by surrender to a fictitious
vindicator, is a question. Accord-

power: the other school think that
the effect is the same as when the
