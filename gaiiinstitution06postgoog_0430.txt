408 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [m.§§12s-134.

paginam facit, Hist. Nat. 2, 7. ‘ Fortune is debited with everything
and credited with everything, and, in the book-keeping of mortale,
Fortune alone occupies both the pages.' According to Dionysius
of Halicarnassus every Roman had to take an oath once in five
years before the Censors that his book-keeping was honest and
accurate.

One species of Literal obligation, namely Expensilation‚ in the
nature of a novation or transformation of a pre-existing debt into
one of a stricter form, was effected by au entry in these domestic
registerS, and from Cicer0, Pro Roscio Comoed0, we may infer that
the entry was binding even though it had not been transferred ⁸
from the Adversaria to the Codex. The creditor, apparently, with
the consent and by the order of the debtor, debited the latter with
a certain sum in the books of the creditor (expensilatio). Aster-
wards a corresponding entry was made by the debtor in the books
of the debtor (acceptilatio). The literal contract, however, appears
to have been complete without the latter entry.

'Phe lender dictated to the borrower the entry to be made in the

books of the borrower.

Scribe decem a Nerio. Non est satis. Adde Cicutae
Nodosi tabulas centum: mille adde catenas:

Effugiet tamen haec sceleratus vincula Proteus.

. . . Putidius multo cerebrum est, mihi crede Perilli
Dictantis quod tu nunquam rescribere possis—Horace.

‘ Enter ten sestertia to the credit of Nerius. ”ris not enough.
Add covenants of Cicuta the knot-tier on a hundred pages3 add a
thousand chains: yet the wily Proteus will escape these bonds. . . .
Greater far is the madness of Perillius [Nerius] to dictate credits
which your debits can never balance.' [Perhaps the true lender
is Perillius, and Nerius and Cicuta are only two bankers in whose
books the same debt is contemporaneously recorded. For this
practice, see Dig. 2, 14, 9, as presently quoted]

Apparently, the true contract was the entry in the creditor’s
book. 'I'he consent (jussus) of the debtor to this entry was neces-
sary, but not restricted to any particular form. The entry in the
debtor’s book was evidence, but not the only admissible evidence,
that he had assented to the entry in the creditor's book.

Theophilus, in his Greek version of the Institutes, gives the
following account of the process: ἦ δὲ literis [ἑυοχὴ] ἐστὶ τὸ παλαιὸν
