effect as the legis actio, and extinguish ipso jure the plaintiff’s
right of action. In Real actions and actions in factum, therefore,' ι*
even though in other respects they were legitima, that is, fell under
the definition of the lex Aebutia, the defendant required the pro- j
tection of the exceptio rei judicatae. 'Phe result ξε, that some
actions which were statutable so far as pendency was concerned‚
inasmuch as they fell under the statute called lex J ulia, were
not statutable so far as novation was concerned, inasmuch as they
fell outside the statute called lex Aebutia.

ξ 109. The nature of the lex Ovinia is not known.

The same imperium mixtum whence emanated new actions in
favour of the plaintiff also issued exceptione in favour of the de-
fendant, and in particular the exceptio rei judicatae, which supple-
mented the novation or consumption whereby a right of action was
extinguished or annihilated (ipso jure, ᾧ 106). The aim of the
legislator in barring once-used rights of action by consumption
(novatio) or exceptio rei judicatae, was to protect a defendant from
being harassed by successive suits, and to guard against the public
evil which would arise in the shape of a general unsettlement and
uncertainty of rights if judicial decisione were not conclusive.
Singulis controversiis singulas actiones unumque judicati finem suf-
ficere probabili ratione placuit, ne aliter modus litium multiplicatus
summam atque inexplicabilem faciat difficultatem, maxime si diversae
pronuncientur‚ Dig. 44, 2, 6. ‘ That one right of action should
only be tried once is a reasonable rule to prevent interminable
litigation and the embarrassment of contrary decisione? Accord-
ingly, it was adopted as a maxim that (in the absence of appeal or
after appeal) judicial decisione should be assumed to be true. Res
judicata pro veritate accipitur, Dig. 1, 5, 25. 'I'he principle may
be stated more at length as follows: A judgment shall not be con-
tradicted by a judgment in a subsequent trial between the same
parties where the same right is in question (except, of course, by
the judgment of a court of appeal). Exceptio rei judicatae obstat
quotiens inter easdem personas eadem quaestio revocatur vel alio
genere judicii, Dig. 44, 2, 7, 4. ‘'I'he plea of previous judgment
is a bar whenever the same question of right is renewed between
the same parties by whatever form of action.’ Let us consider
more minutely the import of this rule.

The parties must be the same. Res inter alios judicatae nul-
lum aliis praejudicium faciunt, Dig. 44, 2, 1. ‘ A judgment be-
