the mortgagee acquired no possession. The fictitious usucapion-
possession of the mortgagor was in the interest of the mortgagee,
whose security against third persons would be corroborated by the
usucapion of the mortgagor.

The depositary has mere detention, the depositor has possession.
'I'he depositary only acquires possession in one case, that is, when
he is made a stake-holder for this very purpose. Rei depositae
proprietas apud deponentem manet sed et possessio, nisi apud
sequestrem deposita est; nam tum demum sequester poaeidet: id
enim agitur ea depositione ut neutrius poaeessioni id tempus pro·
cedat, Dig. 16, 3, 17. ‘ The property and possession of the thing·
deposited remain with the depositor, except when possession as well
as detention is expressly delivered to a stake-holder: for this is the
only sequestration where possession passes, the object being to
interrupt the usucapion of both litigants.’ It seems, then, that in
Sequestration not even usucapion-possession can be ascribed to the
victor in the suit, Dig. 41, 2, 39.

With Permissive occupation (precarium) possession passes, unless
it is expressly agreed that only detention shall pass. Meminisse
autem nos oportet, eum qui precario habet, etiam possidere, Dig.
43, 26, 4, 1. ‘The occupant by permission has possession.' Is
qui rogavit ut precario in fundo moretur, non possidet, sed possessio
apud eum qui concessit remanet, Dig. 43, 26, 6, 2. ‘ The grantes
of permissive detention does not possess, but possession remains
with the grantor? The grantor always retained usucapion-posses-
sion, Dig. 43, 26, 15, 4.

The defendant in a vindicatio has detention but not necessarily
possession. Officium autem judicis in hac actione hoc erit, ut judex
inspiciat an reus possideat. . . . Quidam tamen, ut Pegasus, eam
solam possessionem putaverunt hanc actionem complecti quae locum
habet in interdicto Uti possidetis vel Utrubi. Denique ait, ab eo
apud quem deposita sit vel commodata vel qui conduxerit . . . quia
hi omnes non possident, vindicari non posse. Puto autem ab om-
nibus, qui tenent et habent restituendi facultatem, peti posse, Dig.
6, l, 9. ‘ Although it is not expressed in his commission, the
judex must see whether the defendant is in possession. Some
think the same possession is required as for the interdicts; and
that, accordingly, the depositary, bormwer, hirer, not having s'uch
possession, cannot be defendants in a vindication. But, in truth,
whoever has detention and the means of restitution, may be made
