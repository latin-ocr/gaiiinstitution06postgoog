11. §§ 147-151.] EREPTION FOR INDIGNITY. 247

hereditaments in order ιο defraud a legates (whereupon the heir
forfeited the fourth which he was entitled ιο retain from such
legacy by the lex Falcidia), the discovery that though putative son
he was not a genuine son of the testator, the deliberate cancella-
tion of his name by the testator, the imperfect execution of a
subsequent will in which he was excluded from the heritage, a
codicillary declaration of his unworthiness to inherit, διο.

Grounds on which an heir forfeited his portion· to persons other
than the Fiscus were: neglect on the part of a mother ιο demand
a guardian for her infant child, a second marriage by a mother
who herself is guardian before she has caused another guardian to
be substituted‚ neglect of a lunatic testator, neglect to ransom the
testator, criminal prosecution of testator, Sne.

Grounds exclusively affecting a legatee and that in favour of
the successor are thefl. from the heritage and conceal ment of the
testator's will.

One of the grounds of Ereption we have seen ιο Βο’ the
imperfect Rupture of a will. The Rupture (ruptio) of a will was
produced by two circumstances: (1) Agnatio postumi, the sub-
sequent birth of a sels-successor, or the coming into existence of
a quasi postumus, ᾗ 139: and (2) Revocation. On the principle,
Nihil tam naturale est quam eo genere quidque dissolvere quo
colligatum est (3 ξ 1⁷4), the most formal Revocation of a will
would be the execution of a subsequent will. Another mode of
Revocation sanctioned by J ustinian depended on two conditione:
a declaration attested ΒΥ three witnesses or made in the form of a
record or protoeol deposited in the archives of a court, and the
expiration of ten years from the date of the execution of tlie will,
C. 6, 23, 27.

The mere cancellation or obliteration of a will was an informal
Revocation and left the will valid at civil law: the devisee, how-
ever, was not allowed ιο take the inheritance against this evidence
of the testator's change of intention, but forfeited the succession as
indignus. The rescript of Marcus Aurelius to this effect, to which
Gaius alludes, is preserved in the Digest, 28, 4, 3. The forfeiture
according to Gaius and to Papinian, D. 34, 9, 12, was in favour of
the Fiscus: but according to Ulpian‚ D. 38, 6, 18, and Paulus,
D. 28, 4, 4, it was sometimes in favour of the persons entitled ΒΥ
intestacy.

’ Justinian ordained that a will should be perfeetly Revoked and
