A manager or agent (procurator) has detentiou, not possession.
, Nec idem est possidere et alieno nomine possidere, nam is pos-
sidet cujus nomine possidetur. Procurator alienae ,possessioni
praestat ministerium, Dig. 41, 2, 18. ‘ Possession differs from
detention in the name of another, for he has possession of a thing
in whose name it is held. Au agent is the instrument of another
person's possession.' Generaliter quisquis omnino nostro nomine
sit in possessione, veluti procurator, hospes, amicus, nos possidere
videmur, Dig. 41, 2, 9. ‘ The occupatiori of a procurator, guest, or
friend in our name is our possession.'

A borrower has only detention‚ the lender retains possession. Rei
commodatae et possessionem et proprietatem retinemus, Dig. 13, 6, 8.

A lessee (conductor) has detention, the lessor (locator) possession.
Et fructuarius, et colonus, et inquilinus sunt in praedio et tamen
non possident, Dig. 43, 26, 6, 2. ‘The usufructuary, tenant, and
lodger have occupation, but not possession.' Per colonos et inqui-
linos aut servos nostros possidemus, Dig 41, 2, 25, 1. ‘ Our
farmerS, lodgers, and slaves are instruments of our possession.’

The Emphyteuta had possession as well as detention. Emphy-
teusis was originally regarded as a species of locatio or venditio,
but Zeno decided that it was a conti-act sui generis, aud governed
by its own rules, Inst. 3, 24, 3. The relation of emphyteuta to
dominus was the same as in feudal times the relation of the free-
holder or copyholder to the lord. The emphyteuta was grantee
of land in perpetuity‚ subject to payment of a rent. The property
remained in the grantor, but the emphyteuta had a jus in rem
nearly amounting to property, for he could alienate the land and
recover it by vindication from any possessor and, as long as he paid
his rent, from the grantor, Dig. 6, 3. The dominus probably re-
tained usucapion-possession.

The mortgagor had by a legal fiction usucapiou-possession, the
mortgagee had interdict—possession. Qui pignori dedit ad usuca·
pionem tantum possidet3 quod ad reliquas omnes causas pertinet,
qui accepit possidet, Dig. 41, 3, 16. The mortgagee could recover ¹
the pledge by actio in rem quasi Serviana, Inst. 4, 6, ’7. Here,
then, interdict-possession apPears to be a jus in rem, for it is re-
coverable by vindicatiO. But instead of identifying the mortgagee's
jus in rem and his interdict-possession, it is more correct to regar-d
his jus in rem and his interdict-possession as distinct though con-
current. In a hypotheca, that is, an agreement without delivery,
