object of the obligation from a common debtor, or 66611 debtor was
severally liable 10 pay the whole object of the obligation to a
common creditor. 'I'he ordinary rule, 10 which Correality forms an
exception, is that when there 616 many creditors or many debtors
in an obligation, the Objeet of the obligation is correspondingly
divided3 so that each creditor is only entitled to recover a pro-
portional fraction of the advantage and each debtor is only bound
10 bear a proportional fraction of the bui-den. In Correality each
creditor is several& entitled to receive, and each debtor is severally
bound to discharge, the whole Object of the obligation. By the
ordinary rule, the creditore would be only joina-3( entitled to receive
the whole object3 and this the debtors would be only jointly bound
to discharge3 66611 creditor would be several& entitled to receive only
a ratable part of the Object of the obligation, and a ratable part of 1116
Object is all that each debtor would be severally bound to discharge.

Correality may originate in various modes:

(a) Contract, whether Formal 01 1101611666, Dig. 45, 2, 9, 16 which
there are several promisors or several promisees. The usual origin
of Correality was Verhal contract 01 Stipulation.

(b) Testament: e. g. when a testator charges several successore
alternatively with the payment of 6 leg-acy.

(c) Co-ownership: e. g. when the co·proprietors of a slave are
liable for a noxal action for some mischief that he has committed.

(d) Potestas patria, or dominica, or Mandatum, when the sup-
erior (father or master or principal) is liable 10 an actio adjectitiae
qualitatis (actio de peculio, de in rem vers0, quod jussu, institoria,
exercitoria, 4 ξ 69) for the debt of the inferior (son, or slave, or
agent). There is Correality between the inferior and superior, and
the creditor can elect which he will sue. The Correality of the
inferior and superior is here symbolized in the intentio or deela-
ration of the plaintiff, which is identical in form whether the suit in

1 brought against the inferior or the superior.

Correality not only as denoting total or integral liabih‘ty on the
part of the debtor, and total or integral claim on the part of the
creditor, furnishes a contrast to partial or fractional (in partem, pro
rata) liability or claim3 but must also 116 distinguished from another
relation of co-debtors and co·creditors to which ‚it is much more

in th is, that in both of them every creditor is severally entitled to
receive the whole object of the active obligation, and every debtor
