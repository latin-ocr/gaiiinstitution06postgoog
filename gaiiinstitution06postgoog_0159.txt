1. ξξ 185-188.] DE ATILIANO TUTORE ΕΤ JULIOTITIANO. 137

subject often occupied the attention of the senate. The reason was
that the lex Atilia, presently mentioned, had received, after the
wont of the ancient jurists, a strictly literal interpretation, and was
not deemed to author-ize the substitution of a guardian when the
existing guardian was incapacitated.

DE Ammo TUTOBE, m· ΕΟ QUI Ex LEGE IULIA ΕΤ ΤῘΤΙΔ DATUB.

ξ 185. Si cui nullus omnino tutor
sit, ei datur in urbe Roma ex lege
Atilia a praetore urbano et maiore
parte Tribunorum plebia, qui Atilia-
nus tutor vocatur; in provinciis vero
a praesidibus provinciarum ex lege
Iulia et Titia.

ξ 186. Et ideo si cui testamento
tutor sub condicione aut ex die
certo datus sit, quamdiu condicio
aut dies pendet, tutor dari potest,-
item si pure datus fuerit, quamdiu
nemo heres existat, tamdiu ex iis
legibus tutor petendus est z qui de-
sinit tutor esse postea quam quis ex
testamento tutor esse coeperit.

ξ 187. Ab hostibus quoque tutore
capto ex his legibus tutor (latur, qui
desinit tutor esse, si is qui captus
est in civitatem reversus fuerit:
nam reversus recipit tutelam iure

postliminii.

ξ 188. Ex his apparet quot sint
species tutelarum. si vero quaera-
mus, in quot genera hae species de-
ducantur, lonqa erit disputatio :
nam de ea re valde veteres dubi·
taverunt, nosque diligentius hunc
tractatum exsecuti sumus et in
edicti interpretatione, etin his libris

ᾗ 185. Failing every other form
of guardian, at Rome a guardian is
appointed under the lex Atilia by
the praetor of the city and the
major part of the tribunes of the
people, called an Atilian guardian τ
111 the provinces, a guardian is ap-
pointed by the president of the pro-
vince under the lex J ulia and Titia.

ξ 186. Accordingly, on the ap-
pointment of a testamentary guar-
dian subject to a condition, or on an
appointment limited to take effect
after a certain time, during the
pendency of the condition and be-
fore the expiration of the term, a
substitute is appointed by these
magistrates3 als0, when the appoint-
ment of a testamentary guardian is
not subject to a condition, so long
as the succession has not vested, a
temporat-y guardian may be ob-
tained under those statutos, whose
office will determine as soon as
the testamentary guardianship has
vested.

ξ 187. 011 the hostile capture of
a guardian the same statutes regu-
late the appointment of a substitute
to continue in office until the return
of the captive; for if the captive
returns he recovers the guardianship
in virtue of his rehabilitation.

ξ 188. The foregoing statement
shows the various forms of guar-
dian: the question of the number
of orders to which these forms may
be reduced involves a long discus·
sion, for it is a point on which the
ancient jurists differed greatly ; and
as Ι have examined it at length,
