the inker-itam& the bequest of a legacy, {f the heir accept the in-
her-itam,- the promise of a dower‚ {f the marriaqe is celebrated ; the
seeming condition is required by the law, and its expression is
superfluous: such an event, therefore, is not a genuine condition.
Again‚ the nexus between the minor and middle terms may be
either the will of the person entitled (conditio potestativa, Cod. 6,
51, 7), or chance (conditio casualis); but one way or other the
minor promise must be contingent3 the fulfilment of the condition
must be neither Necessary nor Impossible: it must be a future and
uncertain contingency whether the title (B) shall be realised or
fulfilled in respect of a given person (C). The condition, accord-
ingly, must not be a past or present event, e. g. {f Titius was consul
last year, ff Titius is now consul ,· such a fact is now certain and
Necessary, and any disposition contingent thereon is really un-
conditional.

'l'he effect of an Impossible condition is different in Contracts
and Testamentary dispositions3 it invalidates contract3 whereas in
a testament it is deemed unwritten (pro non scripto habetur), and
the disposition is regarded as nnconditional. This was the rule
that finally prevailed: Obtinuit, impossibiles conditiones testamento
adscriptas pro nullis habendas, Dig. 35, 1, 1, 3. ‘ It has been
finally decided that impossible conditions to testamentary dis-
positione are mere surplusage.' 'l'his was the doctrine of the
sabiniam, and was confirmed by J ustinian‚ lust, 2, 14, 10. Illegal
and immoral conditione followed the same rule as impossible con-
ditions. The question why Contracts and Wills were governed by
different rules, which Gaius admits to be obscure, may receive some
light from the following considerations. Testamentary dispositions
in their nature are acts of liberality on the part of the testator.
Even when he employs them as inducements to an illegal or im-
moral act, it is not quite certain that the refusal to perform the act
would deprive the devisee of his liberality. At all events, the
devisee is innocent of unlawful intention, and the same cannot be
said of the contractor who is guilty of an agreement to violate the
law. Accordingly, the law aids the devisee but not the contractor;
and the rule, once established for immoral conditione, was extended
to impossible conditions.

On this point the French code* agrees with the Roman law. μ .

In the Austrian code the Proculeian doctrine is followed: i. e. tes-
tamentary dispositione as well as contracts are invalidated by im-
