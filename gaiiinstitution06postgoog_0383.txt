contract), or Consensual (Emptio, Locatio, Societas, Mandatum).
Formal contracte derive their validity from the observance of a
symbolic form prescribed by positive law, and calculated to inspire
by its solemnity serious reflection in the negotiatore, and to distin-
guish definitive resolution from preparatory negotiation and debate.
In Real contract the earnestness and definitiveness of the resolution
is proved by one contractor parting with property or possession.
The obligation, too, contracted by the other party is perfectly plain,
being in most cases simply restitution. In Exchange (permutatio),
an Innominate contract, the duty of the promisor is not quite so
simple3 it is not restitution, but the transfer of an equivalent3 and,
accordingly, the validity of the contract of Exchange was not
established till a comparatively late period of Roman jurisprudence.
'Phe daily and hourly employment of the Consensual contracts of
Purchase and Hiring, while it would make the requirement of any
formality intolerably inconvenient, also readers the nature of these
contraets perfectly familiar to all the world, so that the mere men-
tion of their Names awakens as vivid a picture of their consequences
as could the observance of the most ceremonious Form. In the
remaining Consensual contracte, Agency and Partnership‚ the posi-
tion of the Agent or Partner who is called to account for property
that has passed into his hands or that has been lost by his
negligence is so similar to that of a party to a Real contract that
there could be no hesitation in extending to these contracte the
protection of the public tribunals.

A convention that was neither valid by its Form‚ nor was one
of the four Consensual contracte with their familiar Names, nor
was a Real contract, that is, a convention where on one side the
consideration (causa praeter conventionem, Dig. 2, 14, 7, 4) was
executed, nor was made valid by the edict or any special statute,
was not directly enforceable at law, and was called a Nudum pactum.
A Nude pact, though ineffectual to produce civilis obligatio, pro-
duces naturalis obligatio, Igitur nuda pactio obligationem non
parit, sed parit exceptionem, Dig. 2, 14, 7, 4. ‘ A nude pact creates ι
no (civil) obligations* but creates a defence.’ Interest on a loan s
could only be secured by the Formal contract of stipulatio: buts
a nude pact to pay·interest could be confirmed by pignu8‚ Dig. 13,
⁹7, 11, 3, and could be pleaded in bar to a suit for recovering back
the interest when actually paid (condictio indebiti soluti): and we
have seen that exceptio, pignus, solutum non repeti, are some of
