DE mmmm PATRONORUM TUTELA.

ξ 165. Ex eadem leqe duodecim
tabularum libertorum et liberam—um
tutela ad patronos liberosque eorwm

ξ 165. 'Phe same statute of the

Twelve Tables assigns the guardian-
ship of freedmen and freedwomen

τ ocatur: ‘non quia nominatim ea

et agnatos quos ad hereditatem

vocavit, eosdem et tutores esse
iusserat.

dren, and this guardianship, like
that of agnates, is called statutory
guardianship‚ not that it is any-
where expressly enacted in that
body of statutes, but because their
interpretation by the jurists has pro-
cured for it as much reception as it
could have obtained from express
enactment3 for the fact that the
succession of a freedman or freed-
woman, when they die intestato,
was given by the legislator to the
patron and patron’s children, was
deemed a proof of his intention to
give them the wardship, because
when he was dealing with agnates

he had coupled wardship with suc-
cessmn.

DE mmmmm TUTELA.

ξ 166. Exemplo patronorum etiam
fiduciariae tutelae receptae sunt. eae

enim tutelae scilieet fiduciariae vo-
cantur proprie, quae ideo nobis
competunt, quia liberum caput

ξ 166. The analogy of the patron
guardian led in its turn to fiduciary
guardianship. Fiduciary guardian-
ship arises when a free person, man-
cipated by a parent or by the party
to a coemption, is manumitted by
the alienes.

ξ 167. The guardianship of Latius,
male or female, below the age of
puberty, does not necessarily de-
volve on their manumitter, like
their succession, but on whoever be·
fore manumission was their quiritary
owner. Accordingly, a female slave
belonging to you as quiritary owner,
to me as bonitary owner, if manu-
mitted by me without your joining
in the manumission, becomes a
Latin, and her succession devolves
on me, her guardianship on you, by
