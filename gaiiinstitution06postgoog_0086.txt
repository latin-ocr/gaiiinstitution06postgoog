non tamen et jure naturali 3 quia quod ad jus naturale attinet, omnes
homines aequales sunt, Dig. 50, 17, 32. ‘ Before the Civil law a
slave is nothing, but not before the Natural law3 for in the eye of
Natural law all men are equal.' The belief in a Natural law, more
venerable than any Civil law, was very prevalent in the ancient
world, and one of the principal contributions of Philosophy to
civilization.

The absolute privation of all rights was sometimes expressed by
saying that a slave has no persona, caput, or status: e. g. Servos
quasi nec personam habenteS, Nov. Theod. 17. ‘ Slaves being re-
garded as impersonal men? Servus manumissus capite non minui-
tur quia nullum caput habet, Inst. 1, 16, 4. ‘ A slave by manu-
mission loses no rights, having none to lose.' Cum servus manu-
mittitur, quia servile caput nullum jus habet, ideo nec minui potest,
eo die enim incipit statum habere, Dig. 4, 5, 4. ‘ A slave who is
manumitted, having no rights, cannot lose any, for all bis rights
date from the day of his manumission.' The word ‘persona,’ how-
ever, is sometimes applied to slaves: e.g. in personam servilem
nulla cadit obligatio, Dig. 50, 17, 22. ‘ A slave can owe no obliga-
tion 3’ see also GaiuS‚ 1 ξ 17. So is caput in one of the above

quoted passages.
