generally cannot precede an interpellation or demand of payment:
but the omission of a demand is precisely a part of that course of
remissness and negligence whereby‚ under the rules of Prescription,
a creditor ultimately forfeits his right to sue. Savigny, ᾧ 239.

Mora in the sphere of Obligat-ion and Personal actions exactly
corresponds to Mala fides or Mala fide possessio in the sphere of
Dominion and Real actions. Both imply a consciousness of wrong,
that is to say, Culpa in the larg-er sense in which it comprehends
Dolus: with this reservation‚ that Mora is an omission or nega-
tive act, which sometimes arises, not from want of will, but from
want of means or ability to pay; whereas Mala fide possessio is a

positive act that is always wilful and dolose. Both Mora, then, and
Mala fide possessio have a delictual character.

Litis Cg-ntestatio, the first stage in an action, another landmark
of great importance in Roman jurisprudence in ascertaining and
measuring the sanctioning rights and obligations of suitors, is a
kind of bilateral Disposition which may be classed among Quasi-
contracts and, except when merely frivolous and vexatiOuS, is en-
tirely devoid of delictual character. The consequences, however, of
Litis contestatiO, in spite of this difference of character, are similar
to those of Mora and Mala fide possessio, For, in order to save a ’
plaintiff from being ruined by the duration of a trial, Litiscontes-
tatio is supposed to be followed immediately by judgment3 or, in
other words, Litis contestatio entitles him, in respect of fructus and
usurae, to all the rights to which he is entitled by lata sententia.

The rules for the restitution by a defendant of all the accessions
(omnis causa), that is of fruits and interest, in addition to the prin-
cipal subject of litigation‚ are the following:

(A) In real actions a Bona fide possessor, in respect of the period
before Litis contestatio, is only liable for fructus satagit-cs: that is,
he is bound to restore such fruits of a fruit-producing movable or
immovable as still remain in his possession: but hc is not liable to
make compensation for fructus consumptos, such fruits as he has

oonsumed before ,Igitis contestatio: nor is he liablc sor what are
sometimes called fructus percipiendi, but which perhaps are better
called fructus neglecti, fruits which he has neglectcd or carelessly
allowed to perish, before that period.
After Litis contestatio a Bona fide possessor is liable both for the
fruito that he consumes and for those that he allows to perish.
