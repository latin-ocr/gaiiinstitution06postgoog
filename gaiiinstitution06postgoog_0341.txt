ξ 37. Idem iuris est, si intestato
aliquo mortuo suus heres noluerit
petere bonorum possessioneng con·
tentus leyitimo iuro. nam et agnato
competit quidem bonorum possessio,
sed sine re, cum evinci hereditas ab
suo herede potest. et illud conve-
nienter, si ad agnatum iure civili

ξ 37. The same happens when a
man dies intestato and a sels-suc-
cessor omits to demand possession,
contenting himself with his statutor-y
title3 for an agnate may obtain a
grant of intestate possession, but it
will be ineffeotive, because he can
be evicoed by the sels-successor.
Similarly, if an agnate entitled by
civil law accepts the succession but
omits to demand possession, a eog-
nate can obtain a grant of intestate
possession, but only ineffectively,

for the same reason.

ξ 38. There are other similar
cases, some of which were mentioned

in the preceding book.

ᾧ 25. To the divergence of the juristie (agnatio) and natural
(cognatio) families, to the desire, that is, to correct the non-

ᾧ 28. There is no other trace of a difference of opinion as to the
order in which a remoter agnate was entitled on the renunciation of
a nearer. J ustinian states that before his time such an agnate was
only entitled to succeed in the order of cog-nates, but altered the
rule and allowed him to succeed in the order of agnates; that is to
say, introduced a devolution of title from nearer to remoter agnates
on the renunciation of the former, Inst. 3, 2, 7.

ᾧ 32. 'Phe praetor, as executive power:

(1) Gave possession to the person entitled by law, that is, en-
forced the rights conferred on persons by the law; e. g. he gave
juxta-tabular possession to the testamentary heir, ξ 36, οι· eontra-
tabular possession to praetermitted children, 2 ᾧ 125, or ab in-
testato possession to the suus heres or the agnate, § 37.

(2) He also gave possession to persons on whom the law had
conset-red no rights, that is, he supplemented the law; e. g. in
default of sui heredes and agnates he granted ab intestato possession

to cognates; he gave juxta-tabular possession to the devisee under.
