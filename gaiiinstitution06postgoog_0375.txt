is qui se in adoptionem dedit, vel
quae in manum convenit, ad ipsum
quidem coemptiouatorem aut ad pa·
trem adoptivum pertinet heredita-

suo nomine ipse pater adoptivus
aut comptionator heres fit, directo
tenetur iure, non vero is qui se
adoptandum dedit, quaeve i‘n ma-
num convenit, quia desinit iure
civili heres esse. de eo vero quod

buerint, licet neque pater adoptivus
teneatur neque coemptionator, neque
ipse quidem qui se in adoptionem
dedit vel quae in manum convenit
maneat obligatus obligatave, quia

and claims disputed in a pending
statutory trial.

ξ 84. conversely, as to what is
owed by the person adopted or the
woman subjected to hand, if it is
a debt of an ancestor or testator,
the fictitious purchaser or adoptive
father, by acquiring the successim,
becomes directly liable, while the
person adopted and woman sold
into subjection are released from
liability by ceasing to be successors
at civil law; but if the debt was
owed in their own name, their
adoptive father or fictitious pur-
chaser incurs no liability‚ while the
person adopted and woman sold
into subjection cea-se to be liable at
civil law, their liability being extin-
guished by their loss of status:
they are liable, however, in a prae·
torian action based on a feigned re-
storation of their status (4 ξ 38),
and if the action is not defended
the goods which would have be-
longed to them but for their degra-
dation may be all sold by their
creditore on obtaining the requisito
permission of the praetor.

ᾧ 84. By arrogation a man descended from tbe superior status
of paterfamilias to the inferior status of filiusfamilias, from domestic
independence to domestic dependence. It operated, that is to say,

a degradation (capitis minutio minima).

Capitis minutio minima

had various effects on a man's rights and obligations :—
(α) As it implied a change of family, it entailed a loss of rights
founded on agnation, including the sworn services of a freedman.
(b) It involved some forfeiture of rights contested in a legitimum
judicium (3 ᾖ 181), but on this point the state of the MS. of Gaius

leaves us in the dark.

(c) It had further effecte which perhaps we must be contented
at the present day to regard as merely positive and inexplicable.
