unlawful until restitution was claimed, Savigny‚ ᾧ 264. This pos-
session is probably the key to an enigmatical rule in Roman law:
ipsum sibi causam possessionis mutare non posse, Dig. 41, 3, 33, 1 ς
causam possessionis neminem sibi mutare posse, Dig. 41, 5, 2, 1.
‘ No man can change at pleasure his title of possession? 'With the
intention, apparently, of limiting the operation of possessio pro
possessore, an anomalous institution of questionable expediency, the
rule declares that a person who commences his possession or de-
tention of a thing in the character of a vendes from a non-proprietor,
or as lessee, borrower, depositary, or even thies, shall not be able, on
the death of the true proprietor, to accelerate or initiate usucapion
by merely professing that he ceases to hold in his former character
and proceeds to hold as possessor pro possessore.

Possessio pro possessore was perhaps the germ of the intestato
succession of next of kin or cognati, a succession, as we shall see,
not originally recognized in Roman law3 at least, the family or next
of kin of an intestate would generally have the best chance of
seizing any movables or immovables that he left3 and perhaps it
was this equitable result, no less than the object mentioned by
Gaius, that, in the absence of a regular succession of cognati, led the
public to look on possessio pro possessore as a rational and salutary
institution. A curicus parallel, in respect of the religious motive of
the legislator, is to be found in the rule of English law respecting
Onster, or dispossession, of the incorporeal bereditament called an
Advowson. When a stranger that bath no right presenteth a
clerk, who is thereupon admitted and instituted, unless within six
months aster the avoidance the patron pursues his right by the
possessor-y action of Quare impedit, he loses that presentation as a
punishment for his own negligence, and for the peace of the
church z though he may present on the next vacancy as if no such
usurpation had happened. Originally he lost the inheritance of the
Advowson, though he might recover it for future presentations by
dreitural writ of right of advowson. The reason given for his
lesing the present turn and not ejecting the usurper’s clerk, was,
that the final intent of the law in creating this species of property
being to have a fit person to celebrate divine service, the law pre-
ferred the peace of the chureh, provided a clerk were once admitted
and instituted, to the right of any patron whatever.

The institution of usucapio pro herede and pro possessore, or rather
the Sc. J uventianum by which it was defeated, has left its traces in
