be necessary to wait a certain time to see whether it was obeyed
or disobeyed by the defendant3 and if it was disobeyed‚ there would
be at any time within the period of a year a second in jus vocatio
for the nomination of the judex and the delivery of the formula
arbitraria, if the procedure was non-penal; or for the sponsio and
delivery of the formulas of action on the sponsio and the judicium
secutorium, if the procedure was penal.

The intel-dict or command of the magistrate, like the law or
command of the legislator, has two members (protasis and apodosis);
or two terms, an antecedent (a title expressed by the middle term
B) and a consequent (an obligation expressed ΒΥ the major term A).
The antecedent term is usually introduced ΒΥ a relative (Quorum
bonorum, Unde dejecisti, Uti possidetis, stc.) equivalent to a Si .- ac·
cordingly any interdict may be paraphrased by the proposition: If
such and such antecedent title existe, then thou art under such and
such consequent obligation: and this antecedent, simple as it may
appear, is usually analysable into a variety of conditione. Thus in
Quorum bonorum the antecedent clause and question for the judex
is not only whether certain goods are detained by the defendant,
but also whether the plaintiff had obtained a grant of possession
of these goods, whether such grant was rightfully obtained and in
accordance with the provisions of the edict, &a

ᾧ 166. From the two sponsiones and two restipulationes 'which
are mentioned, it appears that Gaius is now speaking of double
interdicte, and from the words eum fundum easve aedes it appears
that he is speaking not of Utrubi but of Uti possidetis.

After a first in jus vocatio in which an interdict Uti possidetis
had been obtained, there took place, ΒΥ prearrangement, a molesta·
tion of one of the litigante ΒΥ the other. In the disorderly begin-
ning-s of society this molestation was doubtless osten in reality
a turbulent defiance of the magisterial interdict: but in more
ordei-ly periods both parties would be desirous of trying their right
ΒΥ legal course, andthe steps taken by both would be prearranged
with a view of satisfying the conditione of interdict procedure (vis
ex conventu). So a trespass, or at least an act that contains many of
the elementa of a trespass, is often arranged to be committed for the
purpose of enabling parties to try a right before English tribunale.

After the vis ex conventu had been simulated‚ there took place
a second in jus vocatio, at which the parties entered into five
different stipulatione.
