most civil injuries are harmful to the eommunity. A better defi· ⁸

nition is the following: Crimes 810 those unlawful acts which create
an obligation (liabih‘ty 10 punishment) which ean only be remitted
by the State3 Civil injuries are those unlawful acts which engender
an obligation remissible by the private individual whose primary
rights 810 violated.

The following may be taken as a natural classifieation of actions.
Every right of action arises out of 8 delict, i. e. a violation of some
positive or negative obligation.

(1) A violation of a positive obligation, that is, an obligation to
perform, is 8 violation of a jus in personam, and founds 811 8011011
for 11108011 of 0011118011, called an action ex contractu.

(2) A violation of 8 negative obligation, that is, 811 obligation to
abstain‚ is a violation of 8 jus in rem, and either imposes 811 obli-
gation remissible by the individual aggrieved, founding 8 civil
action real or personal, and called in the latter case an action ex
delicto;

(3) Or imposes an obligation remissible by the State but irremis-
sible by the individual, founding 8 criminal prosecution.

plaintiff some thing or service of pecuniary value to which the
plaintiff is entitled. They do not necessarily imputo unlawful dis-
position (dolus or eulpa) to the defendant. Actions ex delicto do
not necessarily imply that the defendant HAS what he ought not to
have3 they necessarily impute unlawful disposition (dolus or culpa)
to the defendant, ξ 211, 811(1 imply imputability‚ or responsibility
for dolus and culpa.

In respect of 0011118010 Culpa is distinguished as of different
degrees 3 and sometimes 8 higher, sometimes a lower degree is
capable of generating obligation. In respect of (1011010 Culpa is not
distinguished by gradations3 the least Culpa suffices to generate
obligation.

All actions ex delicto are PenaI, either bilaterally or unilaterally3
that is, they tend, if not both to enrieh the plaintiff and impoverish
