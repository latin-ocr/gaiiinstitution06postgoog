unemancipated. If the grandchildren are also emancipated,⁴ or if
the grandehildren are emancipated and their father unemancipatess
or if neither the son nor the grandchildren are emancipated, then
the prior right of their father excludes the grandchildren from all
share in the contra-tabular possession. ’

QUIBUS nome TESTAmTA mmmm.

ξ 138. Si quis post factum tes-
tamentum adoptaverit sibi filium,
aut per populum eum qui sui iuris
est, aut per Praetorem eum qui in
potestate parentis fuerit, omnimodo
testamentum eius rumpitur quasi
agnatione sui heredis.

ξ 139. Idem iuris est si cui post
factum testamentum uxorin manum
conveniat, vel quae in manu fuit
nubat: nam eo modo filiae loeo
esse incipit et quasi sua ost.

§140. Nec prodest sive haee,
sive ille qui adoptatus est, in eo
testamento sit institutus institutave.
nam de exheredatione eius super-
vacwum videtur quaerere, cum tes-
tamenti faciundi tempore suorum
heredum numero non fuerit.

ξ 141. Filius quoque qui ex
prima secundave mancipatione ma·
numittitur, quia revertitur in potes-
tatem patriam, rumpit ante factum
testamentum. nec prodest si in eo
testamento heres institutus vel ex-
heredatus fuerit.

§142 Simile ius olim fuit in
eius persona cuius nomine ex sena-
tusconsulto erroris causa probatur,
quia forte ex peregrina vel Latina,
quae per errorem quasi civis Ro-
mana uxor ducta esset, natus esset.
nam sive heres institutus esset a
parente sive exheredatus, sive vivo
patre causa probata sive post mor-
tem eius, omnimodo quasi adgna-
tione rumpebat testamentum.

ἕ 138. If after making his will a
man adopts as son either a pater-
familias by a lex curiata or a filius-
familias by mancipation and ficti·
tious vindication‚ his will is inevit-
ably vacated as it would be by the
subsequent birth of a aelf-successor.

ἕ 139. The same happens ifafter ,

making his will the testator receives
a wife into his hand, or marries a
person who is in his hand, as she
'thereby acquires the rights of a
daughter and becomes his sels-suc-

cessor.

ἕ 140. And it is unavailing that
such a wife or adopted son was in
that will appointed heir, for not
having been sels-successore when
the will was made they clearly
cannot have been therein disin·

herited.
5141. So a son manumitted

after the first or second sale reverts

,into the power of his father and

vacates a previous will, nor does
it avail that he is therein appointed
heir or disinherited.

ἕ 142. The same rule formerly
held of the son in whose behalf the
decree of the senate allows proof of
error, if he was born of an alien
or Latin mother who was married
in the mistaken belief that she was
a Roman [see 1 ξ 67] : for whether
he was appointed heir by his father
or disinherited‚ and whether the
error was proved in his father’s life
or after his death, in every case the
will was avoided as by the sume-
quent birth of a sels-successor.
