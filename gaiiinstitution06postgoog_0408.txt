386 DE OBLIGA'PIONIBUS. [111. ἧς 97-109.

the introduction of an Adstipulator when a person wished 16 sti-
pulate something exclusively for the benefit of his heir, ᾧ 117.
When J ustinian abrogated the 1616 and ordained that an 661 could
be Contracted to be performed either before or after the death of
either of the contractors, cod. 4, 117, the Adstipulator became
unnecessary.

'I'he rule of Paulus would make a promise of payment to the
promisee and a stranger void as to the latter, ξ 103.

The same rule applied to the passive obligation a contract imposed:
the debtor created by a contract could 661 be in the first instance
the heir of the promisor‚ ξ 158. One intelligible motive for

ν prohibiting obligations from taking effect on the death of the

promisor would be to prevent evasione of the testamentary lawa
restricting the powers of testation. A testator who wished 16 16616
a legacy to a person who could not take under a will from want
either of capacitas or of passive TestamentifactiO, or a legacy
beyond the amount permitted by the lex Falcidia or some other
law, would enter into a Stipulation‚ binding his heir 16 pay a
certain sum aster the death of the promisor. 'I'he promisee then
could recover 11116 6616 661 66 legatee but as creditor under the
stipulation. That such evasione were in fact attempted appears
from Dig. 22, 3, 27. Ihering. Is this opening of a door to fraudu-
lent evasions the evil that Gaius intends to express by ‘ Ineleganca’
a somewhat unintelligible term ⁴? J ustinian, however, abolished
the distinctions recorded in this paragraph, and allowed the sti-
pulation of an act to be performed either for the heir of the pro·
161666, or by the heir of the promisor‚ Inst. 3, 19, 13.

ᾧ 103. Α slave or filiusfamilias who stipulated a payment to
himself acquired an obligation for the master or paterfamilias. He
could also stipulate directly a payment to the master or parent.
Except in these relations, it was the rule that a man could not stipu-
1616 for payment to a third person. Payment, however, 16 6 third
party might be secui-ed by a penal clause, stipulating, in defizult of
performance, payment of 6 penal sum 16 the promisee, Inst. 3, 19, 19.

'Phe rule of the Civil law that a Formal eontract could only be
concluded between principale—between persons covenanting in
their own names, was an impediment in the way of commerce
which was met, as we have already stated, by a double use of a
consensual 66611661, which will presently be examined‚ the contract
