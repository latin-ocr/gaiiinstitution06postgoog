follows the status of the mother, that ie, when it is begotten in
gentile marriage or in promiscuous intercourse, the status of the child
is determined by the status of the mother at the moment 01· birth.
In his qui jure contracto matrimonio nascuntur, conceptionis tempus
spectatur3 in his autem qui non legitime concipiuntur, editionis,
Ulpian, 5, 10. ‘ Children born in civil wedlock have their status
fixed at the time 01· conception 3 children born out of civil wedlock
have their status fixed at the time of delivery.' That is to say, the
legal position of the issue is made to follow the analogy 01· its
physical condition. 'Phe physical influence of the father terminates
with conception: his subsequent health, life, or death, does not
affect the physical state of the child; but the child is affected by
every change in the physical condition of the mother, her health,
life, or death, up to the moment of birth. In imitation of this
analogy, the status 01· the child, when it depended on the status of
the father, was not affected by any change in that status subsequent
to the period of conception 3 but when it depended on the status of
the mother it varied with every change in that status up to the
moment 01· birth. By the time of Gaius, though the change is not
mentioned in the text, this rule was modiiied in favour 01· liberty,

·· and it was established that if the mother was free either at the date

of conception or at the date 01· birth or at any intermediate period,
the issue was born free. Si libera conceperit et ancilla facta peperit,
liberum parit, id enim favor libertatis exposcit. Si ancilla conce-
perit et medio tempore manumissa sit, rursus facta ancilla peperit,
liberum parit, media enim tempora libertati prodesse, non nocere
etiam possunt, Paulus, 2, 24, 2.

ᾧ 88. Τ110 issue 01· 8 mother who was a slave at the date 01· con-
ception but is a citizen at the date of birth, though it is born a
Roman citizen, is not subject to patria potestaS, because it does not
satisfiy the definition in ᾧ 55, liberi quos justis nuptiis procreavimuS,
‘ a child begotten in civil wedlock.'

ᾧ 90. Aquae et ignis interdictio was originally a permission to
avoid punishment under the penal code by voluntary exile. Subse-
quently it was employed as a punishment, and under the emperors
assumed the form 01· deportatio in insulam. It was attended with
confiscation 01· goods, and involved loss 01· civitas but not of libertas,
