ᾧ 148. In the absence of express convention a partnership is
limited to gains by commercial transactione (universorum quae ex
quaestu veniunt) and excludes gains by inheritance‚ devise, dona-
tion. A remarkable incident of unlimited partnership (universorum
bonorum) was the transmutation of property operated by mere con-
vention without delivery. In societate omnium bonorum omnes
res quae coeuntium sunt continuo communicantur3 quia licet spe-
cialiter traditio non interveniat, tacita tamen creditur intervenire,
Dig. 17, 2, l, 1. ‘ In partnership of all goods, the property of all
the members becomes forthwith common, a constructive delivery
being implied in the absence of actual delivery? This rule was not
applied to other forms of partnership.

ξ 149. Although a partner might be exempt by the terms of the
· convention from any share in the losses, yet a convention that a
partner should have no share in the gains was called a leonine con-
vention, and being devoid of consideration could not be enforced.
Aristo refert, Cassium respondisse, societatem talem coiri non posse,
ut alter lucrum tantum, alter damnum sentiret, et hanc societatem
leoninam solitum appellare, et nos consentimus, Dig. 17, 2; 29, 2.
‘ Aristo records the decision of Cassius that a partnership on the
terms that one should take all the profits and another bear all the
loss, which he called a leonine partnership, is not binding, and
Ulpian concurs?

ἧ 153. Of the three kinds of capitis minutio, maxima, media,
and minima, that is to say, loss of libertas, loss of civitas, loss of
domestic status, only capitis minutio maxima and media operate a
dissolution of partnership. Societas quemadmodum ad heredes
socii non transit, ita nec ad arrogatorem‚ ne alioquin invitus quis
socius efficiatur cui non velit 3 ipse autem arrogatus socius permanet ;
nam etsi filiusfamilias emancipatus fuerit, permanebit socius, Dig.
17, 23 65, 11. ‘ Partnership passes neither to the heir nor to the
adrogator of a partner, otherwise it might be involuntary3 but an
independent person who becomes dependent by adrogation, and a
