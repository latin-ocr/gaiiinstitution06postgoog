§ 178. Sed dudum quidem pla-
cuit, quamdiu cernere et eo modo
heres fieri possit prior, etiam si pro
herede gesserit, non tamen admitti
substitutum: cum vero cretio finita
sit, tum pro herede gerentem ad-
mittere substitutum ι olim vero pla-
cuit, etiam superante cretione posse
eum 'pro herede gerendo in partem
substitutum admittere et amplius
ad cretionem reverti non posse.

is only admitted to a portion, and
both take a moiety: if he neither
declare nor act as heir, he is entirely
exeluded‚ and the substitute takes
the whole.

ξ 178. It is now a well-estab-
lished rule that, as long as a term
prefixed for declaring and taking the
snccession subsiste, if a person in a
higher grade act as heir, he does
not let in the substitute, and that
even after the expiration of the
term his acts of heirship make him
eoheir with the substitute. It once
was held that, even pending the
allotted term, acts of heirship let in
the substitute and bar the prior
heir from reverting to his right of
formal declaration.

DE PUPILLARI SUBSTITUTIONB.

§ 179. Liberis nostris inpuberi-
bus quos in potestate habemus non
solum ita, ut supra diximus, sub-
stituere possumne, id est ut εἰ here-
des non extiterint, alius nobis heres
sit; sed eo amplius, ut etiam si
heredes nobis extiterint et adhuc
impuberes mortui fuerint, sit iis
aliquis heres, velut hoc modo:

ξ 180. Quo casu si quidem non
extiterit heres filius, substitutus
patri fit heres: si vero heres ex-
titerit filius et ante pubertatem
decesserit, ipsi filio fit heres sub-
stitutus. quamobrem duo quodam-
modo sunt testamenta: aliud patris,
aliud filii, tamquam si ipse filius
sibi heredem instituisset; aut certe
unum est testamentum duarum he-
reditatum.

§ 181. Ceterum ne post obitum

§ 179. To children below the age
of puberty in the power of the tes-
tator, not only can such a substi-
tute as we have described b‘e ap-
pointed, that is, one who shall take
the suecession on their failure to
inherit, but also one who, if aster
inheriting they die before attaining
the age of puberty, shall be their
successor; which may be done in
the following terms: ‘ Be my son
Titius my successor, and if my son
does not become my successor, or
after becoming my successor die
before attaining the age of puberty‚
then be Seius the successor.’

ξ 180. In which case, if the son ·
fail to inherit, the substitute is the
heir of the testator, but if the son
die after inheriting and without
attaining the age of puberty‚ the
substitute is heir to the son. Thus
there are two wills, so to speak, the
father’s and the son’s, just as if the
son had made a successor; or at
anyhrgtve ghelre& one will dealing
