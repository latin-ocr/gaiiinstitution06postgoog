1. βξ 159-164.] DE CAPITIS MINUTIONE. 127

Besides extinguishing the politica] or publicistic elements of
civitas, infamia affected to a certain extent its private elements,
both commercium and connubium3 the former, as we shall see, iu
respect of the office of procurator, 4 ξ 124, and the latter in respect
of the disabilities of celibacy under the lex J ulia, which were not
removed ΒΥ marriage with an infamis. Both these classes of dis-
ability had practically vanished even before they were abolished in
the time of J ustinian.

This seems the proper place to notice certain inequalitics of
condition, analogous to the old distinctions of status, which grew
up in the later ages of Rome, and some of which survived the fall
of the Roman empire. From the establishment of the empire the
army was caressed ΒΥ each succeeding despot, and privileges of
various kinds were so accumulated on the military service, that the
relation of the soldiery to the rest of the world very much resem-
bled the ancient relation of Romanus to peregrinus. 'Phe pre-
eminence of the military caste was the result of elevation; other
unprivileged castes were created ΒΥ depression. As the new reli-
gion grew to political power, zealous legislators were eager to
promote its ascendency by the means of political sanctione.
Pagans, Jews, heretice, apostates, protestante, papists, were suc-
cessively frowned upon ΒΥ the legislator, and for a long season
subjected to incapacities and disabilities as great as, or greater
than, those which weighed upon infamis: until ΒΥ a change in
politica] conceptions these inequalities of right have been again
levelled ancl almost obliterated in most of the codes of modern
Europe. See also the remarks on Colonatus, 3 ᾧ 145.

§162 In the category of domestic position there are three
classes, (1) sui juris, οι· paterfamilias and materfamilias3 (2) filius-
familias and filiafamilias3 and (3) mancipium: but there are only
two possible degradatione, (1) from sui juris to filius· or filia-
familias, which occurs in adrogation and the in manum conventio
of a woman previously independent3 and (2) from filius· or filia-
familias to mancipium, which occurs in noxal surrender, ιιι eman-
cipation‚ in adoption as implying mancipation, and in the remanci-
pation of a woman ΒΥ her husband or the person who held her
in manu in virtue of a fiduciary coemption. The descent from sui
juris to mancipium cannot occur, because the only persons capable
of passing into the condition of mancipium by the process of
mancipation were filius- and filiafamilias and women in manu, i.e.
