650 DE AOEIONIBUS. [xv. ξς 138-170.

observing the practical similarity of the 'Possessory interdicts to the
Possessory real actions, an Englishman will be inclined to look upon
Utrubi and Uti possidetis as practically Real actions and Posses-
sion as practically a Real right. Unde vi implies a genuine tort,
and may find its proper place among Personal actions ex ’ maleficio.
This arrangement has the authority of Vangerow, who introduces
Utrubi and Uti possidetis along with Vindicatio into the law of
Dominion, and makes these interdicte bear towards Vindicatio in
the department of Ownership the relation which in the department
of Succession Quorum bonorum bears to Petitio hereditatis.
That in a given system of positive law what is in substance a
ἱ Real action may assume the form os an action on Delict, we may
convince ourselves by remembering some of the anomalies of the
scheme of actions in English law. Trover and Detinue, which were
brought to recover movable property, and therefore were in sub·
· stance Real actions, were kinds of Trespaas, that is of action on
delict: Assumpsit‚ the remedy for enforcing a simple contract,
was externally a species of 'Prespass on the Case, another action on
delictz and Ejectment, practically the sole real action for the re-
covery of land, was theoretically another species of Trespass.
'Phe interdict, as originating action, bears some resemblance to
a now abolished institution of English law, the Original writ. But
the Original writ was a mandate addressed by the head of adminis-
tration or judicaturo to the sheriff 3 that is, to an executive officer,
not, as the interdict, to the individual suitor. Besides, this man-
date of the crown required the sheriff to command a defendant
to obey the crown by obeying the precepta of the legislator: the
peculiarity of the interdict, as appears from the preceding account
of its character, was that it formed of itself the whole of the law
which the snitor was commanded to obey. The possessory interdicte,
for instance, simple and meagre as they outwardly seemed, really
compriaed the whole law (the whole synthesis of 'Pitle and Obli-
gation) that governed the subject of Possession. And the same
is true of all the other interdicte which have been enumerated.
This, as already observed, is apparently the true interpretation
os th'e terms in which Gaius expresses the distinctive feature of
Interdicts: certis ex causis Praetor aut Proconsul mmmmm
auctoritatem suam finiendis controversiis interponit, ᾗ 139: i. e. in
issuing an interdict the magistrate exercised a principalis auctoritas,
wielded a sovereign authority.
