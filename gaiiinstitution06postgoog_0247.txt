only take one tenth of a heritage, and another tenth for every

living child by a former marriage: further, another tenth for a ·

common child that lived to the day of naming (nominum dies), or
two tenths for two such children, but not more. In addition to
their· tenth, the husband or wife might have the usufruct, and, if

no one is competent to make a will before attaining 21 years

of age.
