SIMULATIVE DISPOSITIONS. 669

transfer of domini0n‚ yet it did not suffice for the purpose of making
the alienor subject to auctoritas, liability to repay twice the pur-
chase money in the event of eviction, PauluS, 2, 1⁷, 1.

Again, the Census, like a year of jubilee, appears to have liberated
from genuine bondage3 but not to have broken the fictitious
bondage of a son who was in the course of emancipation‚ 1 ᾧ 140.

Coemption transferred to the husband the universal estate of the
wife, 2 ᾧ 98. We may infer e contrario that it had not a similar
effect on the property of a woman who merely made a coemption
for the purpose of changing her guardian or acquiring testamentary
capacity.

The genuine sale of a wife was forbidden at an early period under
the severest sanctions: this did not prevent the simulated sale (re-
mancipatio) of a woman by her coemptionator: i. e. the simulating
disposition when once established was free from the supervening
rules of the simulated disposition.

A Testament affected to be a Mancipation: but juris univer-
sitas, the subject of testament, is not found in the catalogue of
mancipable things (res mancipi): a testament was revocable‚ a
mancipation irrevocable: a mancipation could not have its opera-
tion suspended or made contingent on a condition (p. 384), a
testament was a disposition de futuro and might be conditional:
a mancipation only conveyed dominion3 nexum, which imposed
obligation, though cognate, was a distinct institution: testament
both invested the successor with dominion and subjected him to
obligations: mancipation only affected the alienor and alienee‚
testament conferred rights on legateeS‚ i. e. strangers who had in no
way co-operated in the execution of the testament. The sacrifice
of reality to fiction by the slavish adherence to the rules of do-
mesticum testimonium makes it the more remarkable that the
testament should have burst asunder so many other restrictions of

mancipation. Ihering, Geist des Roemischen Rechts, ᾧ 58.
