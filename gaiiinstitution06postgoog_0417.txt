applies.

ᾗ 125. Ιο some circumstances,
however, the law permits a surety
to be bound for an indefinite amount,
as security for dower, for instance,
or for a legacy, or by judicial order.
Also the lex J ulia imposing a duty
of one twentieth on testamentary
successione provides that the secu-

,rities therein required shall be

excepted from the scope of the lex
Cornelia.

ξ 126. The rights of sponsore,
fidepromissors, and fidejussore are
also equal in respect of the rule that
they cannot be bound for more
than their principal. They may,
however, be bound for less, just as
the adstipulator may stipulate for
less. For their obligation, like that
of the adstipulator, is an accessory
of the principal obligaticm and the
accessory cannot be greater than
the principal.

ξ 127. They further resemble 10
this, that whoever pays for the
principal can recover the amount
from him by action of mandate.
Sponsors by the lex Publilia have 80
additional remedy, being able, un·

recover twice the sum advanced by
the action on money paid by a
sponsor.

ξ 110. At the corresponding point of his Institutes J ustinian
introduces the mention of Connmurr (duo rei debendi, duo rei
credendi) and it may be expedient to examine the nature of Cor-
reality before we embark on the consideration of the various forms

of Guaranty.

Correality, the multiplicatiori of the creditore (plures rei credendi)
or debtors (plures rei debendi) in a single obligatiou without a
corresponding division of the Object of the right or obligation, was
an institution of Roman law in favour of creditors3 whereby, ex·
ceptionally and usually in virtue of a special agreement, each
creditor was severally entitled to recover the whole (solidum)
