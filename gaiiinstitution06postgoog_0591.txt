the second clause was not satisfied unless the defensor was prepared
to give further security judicatum solvi. Si vero extrinsecus
persona defensoris interveniat, aeque stipulatio non committetur,
si modo ille paratus sit rem boni viri arbitratu defendere, hoc est
satisdare, Dig. 46, ’7, 5. ‘A defensor may prevent a forfaiture of
the stipulation if he defends “to the satisfaction of an arbitrator,’'
that is, with adequate security? ⁷

J ustinian relieved the defendant in any action who appeared in
his own person from the first and third clauses of the security judi-
catum solvi, but not from the second. The vadimonium or cautio
judicio sistendi, which originally, it seem& only referred to ad-
journed appearances in jure, was at this period extended to the

⁵ judicia, and bound the defendant to appear before the judex and

remain to the end of the trial. If, then, in consequence of an ad-
journment in jure, there had been a vadimonium between the
parties, no further stipulation would be necessary3 otherwise the
defendant would have had to enter into the undertaking that
formed the second clause of the stipulation judicatum solvi. Sed
haec hodie aliter observantur. Sive enim quis in rem actione con-
venitur sive in personam suo nomine, nullam satisdationem pro
litis aestimatione dare compellitur, sed pro sua tantum persona
quod in judicio permaneat usque ad terminum litis, Inst. 4, 11, 2.
‘ This is not the present rule. The defendant now is not required
either in a real or personal action, if he appear in person, to give
security for satisfaction of the judgment, but only for his own
personal presence and continuance in court to the end of the
trial.’

The procurator of the plaintiff appointed before the judex or in
the record office of the magistrate by memorandum (insinuatio)
in the register of his public proceedings (apud acta) was assimilated
to the cognitor whom he superseded, and was not required to give
security3 otherwise he had to give security ratam rem dominum
habiturum.

The procurator of the defendant gave no security3 but his prin-
cipal, as fidejussor of his procurator, gave security for the pro-
curator judicatum solvi, including a mortgage (hypotheca) of all
his property. A defensor (unauthorized representative) of the
defendant gave security judicatum solvi.
