father.

The rules relating to the status of the offspring of parents of
unequal status are at first sight chaotic and bewildering, but they
are reducible to a few canons. 'I'he most general canon is the rule
of Gentile law, that children follow the condition of the mother.
This is subject to two exceptione.

1. Children born in civil wedlock follow the condition of tho
father?

2. Children born in gentile (lawful) wedlock of a Roman mother
and alien father follow the condition of the father: this was a
special enactment of the lex Mensia. These rules are stated in the
following passages: Lex naturae haec est ut qui nascitur sine legi-
timo matrimonio matrem sequatur nisi lex specialis aliud inducat,
Dig. 1, 5. ‘ By the law of nature children not born in civil wedlock
follow the status of the mother, in the absence of a special statute
to the contrary! Connubio interveniente liberi semper patrem
sequuntur: non interveniente connubio, matris conditioni accedunt,
excepto eo qui ex peregrino et cive Romana peregrinus nascitur,
quoniam lex Mensia ex alterutro peregrino natum deterioris parentis
conditionem sequi jubet, Ulpian, 5, 8. ‘ In civil wedlock the children
have the status of the father, in the absence of civil wedlock of the
mother3 except that the children of an alien father and Roman
mother are aliens, as the lex Mensia makes the children aliens when
either parent is an alien.’

The Sc. Claudianum introduced some special enactments respect-
ing the intercourse of freewomen with slaves, which, however, were
subsequently abolished.

a. If a freewoman had intercourse with a slave with the consent
of his proprietor she retained her freedom, though degraded to the
class of a freedwoman, but her issue was the slave of the proprietor.
The slavery of the issue was abolished by Hadrian, ξ 84.

· b. If a freewoman persisted in intercourse with the slave of
another person against the will and in spite of the prohibition of
the proprietor‚ after three denunciations on his part she was awarded
to him by the magistrate as a slave, and her issue, whether born
before or aster the adjudication‚ became slaves of the same person,
who also acquired her estate by a species of universal succession.
