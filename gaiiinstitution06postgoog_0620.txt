annexed to such a fact (demurrer of English law). The question
whether in the formulary system a pure issue of law was decided
by the praetor in jure (denegatio actioniS, when the demurrer was
sustained3 datio actioniS, when it was overruled) without reference
to a judex, is immaterial to our present purpose, which is merely
an exhaustive view of the various modes of defence open to a
defendant.

Or it might be an admission of the fact alleged with an allegation
of a further fact whereby the efficaey of the admitted fact to found
a right was avoided. E. g. the averment of the infancy or lunacy
of a party to a disposition (confession and avoidance of En'glish law,
producing a plea in justification).

ΙΙ. The averment of a subsequent nullification or nx'rmcnox of
the plaintiff’s right, admitted to have previously existed (confession
and avoidance, i. e. confession not only of a fact, as above, but of a
right, with an averment of its subsequent aboliffion, producing a plea
in discharge) e. g. the averment of solutio, acceptilatiO, novati0.

ΙΙΙ. The objection of a colliding right of the defendant, whereby
the right of the plaintiff is not avoided or extinguished but
counterworked or restrained from operation: e. g. resistanee to
an alleged right of a father-in-law by putting forward a counter
right of a husband: or arrest of the exercise of the father’s rights
by confronting them with those of the mother (confession of a
fact or right and, not avoidanee but, coUNTBRAOEION). This third
mode of defence is called Exceptio. Accordingly exceptio may be
rendered a Counteractive or obstructive, as opposed to a Negative
or destructive, plea.

The allegation of an exceptio does not preclude the defendant
from contesting the intentio: Non utique existimatur confiteri de
intentione adversarius, quocum agitur, qui exceptione utitur, Dig.
43, 1, 9, and the intentio must be proved by the plaintiff before
the defendant is called upon to prove the excepti0, Cod. 8, 36, 9:
so that, instead of confession and counteraction, the exception
should be described as a supposition or assumption and counter-
action, of the plaiutiff’s right.

1. Examples of the first line of defence are, in a real action, the
negation of the traditio on which a plaintiff founds his claim of
dominion: in a personal action, negation of the contract or tort
on which the plaintiff founds his claim of obligation: in either
real or personal action, avoidanee of the title alleged by the plaintifl'
