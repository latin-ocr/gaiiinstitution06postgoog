1. §§ 19'7-200] PERSONARUM UNIVERSITAS. 155

constitutions of juristic persons are too various to admit of any
general definition. In towns the supreme direction and represen-
tation belonged to the Senate (curia, ordo). A meeting of two-
thirds of the whole number of members represented the whole
senate, and the vote of the majority in such a meeting was the
decision of the senate.

Although a Universitas is said to hold common property, the
relation of the members of a Universitas must not be identified with
that of Coproprietors (communio). A coproprietor is the separate
proprietor of an undivided ideal portion, which he can aliene, mort·
gage, and otherwise dispose of 3 and which, by requiring a partition
(actio communi dividundo), he can always reduce to a real portion:
whereas the whole of the common property can only be dealt with
if the coproprietors are unanimous. Members of a Universitas, on
the contrary, cannot demand a partition3 and dispositions of the
property of the Universitas can only be made, and can always be
made, by the vote of a majority of two-thirds of the members.

Every juristic person was originally incapable of being instituted
successor (heres), as Pliny mentions in the case of municipalities:
Nec heredem institui nec praecipere posse rempublicam constat.
Epist. 5, 7. ‘ N either successione nor legacies by praeceptio (which
imply that the legatee is also heir, 2 ᾧ 217) can be left to a town.'
J uristic persons were not subject to this incapacity because they
were personae incertae, 2 ᾧ 238, for they are personae certae, but
because, being fictions, they were incapable of aditio, which involves
intention, and excludes representation. First the senate, disre-
garding this difficulty, allowed municipalities to be instituted suc-
cessors by their own liberti, Ulpian 22, 52 and subsequently the

Emperor Le0‚ Δ. Ι). 469, gave to municipalities the capacity of being
instituted successor by any testator, Cod. 6, 24, 12. No general

enactment extended this capacity to all Corporations, but some re-
ceived it as a special privilege.

Originally towns, like other juristic persons, were incapable of
taking bequests (legata), but subsequently towns were declared
capable by Nerva and Hadrian, Ulpian 24, 283 Gaius 2ᾧ 195: and
this capacity was extended to Collegia and Templa, D. 34, 5, 20,
and probably to all juristic personS. Towns were also capable of
taking successione by fideicommissum, Ulpian 22, 5.

Under Christian legislation Pious Foundations (pia corpora) were
made capable of taking hereditas and legatum: and devises of
