gentilicium ius in desuetudinem that the whole law relating to gen·

loco de ea re curiosius tractare. go into its details on the present
occasion.

§9. The term agnatio has already occurred (2 ᾧ 131) in the
exposition of testacy, where it denoted the birth of a ¹suus heres,
and in the doctrine of intestaey it has the same signification. The
same persons who in relation to a common ancestor are sui heredes,
in relation to one another are agnati. Agnates, accordingly, may
be described as all the members of a family3 but then we must add
that the family may either be actual or ideal, meaning by ideal
either a family once actual but disintegrated by the death of the
ancestor, or a family purely imaginary. While the common an-
cestor survives, the bonds of agnation are close, and the family is
actual; aster his death, when his descendants have formed separate
families, all the members of those families are still agnates, because
they are members of an ideal family which once was actual; and
the descendants of those descendants are more remotely agnates,
because, though never members of an actual family, they would
have been so if the common ancestor had lived for, say, a hundred
or a thousand years. “

The words of the Twelve Tables creating title by agnation are
as follow: Si intestato moritur cui suus heres nec escit, adgnatus
proximus familiam habeto. ‘ If a man die intestate leaving no
sslf-successor, his nearest agnate (the nearest sels-successor of one of
his ancestors) shall have the succession.'

ᾗ 10. consanguinei, brothers or sisters by the same father,
opposed to uterini, brothers or sistere by the same mother, are
properly included among agnates, being agnates of the first degree3
but sometimes the word ‘ agnates’ specifically denotes the subse-
quent degrees, and as females were only entitled to inherit by the
first degree of agnation, ᾧ 14, the word ‘agnates ’ was further
limited to denote male agnates, Agnati autem sunt cognati
virilis sexus per virilem descendentes, PauluS‚ Sent. Rec. 4, 8, 13.
‘ Agnates are male cog-nates related through males?

ᾧ 12. If the nearest degree of agnates in existence repudiat-ed
the successim, or died before acceptance, the succession did not

devolve to the next degree of agnateS, but passed by a different title
