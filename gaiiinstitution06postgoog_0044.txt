22 PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS.

accepted. 'The praetor, however, will rescind my act, and restore
me to my former position aud power of abstention.' Such actions
are both Volitional (for the motor organs are set in motion by
Volition) and Intentional‚ for Volition is accompanied by full
knowledge of the character and consequences of the motion pro-
duced. Accordingly the Force that' enters into the definition of
the Voluntary and Involuntary is limited to Vis absoluta and is
thtis defined ε βίαιον δὲ οὗ ἡάρχὴ ἔξωθεν, τοιαύτη οὖσα ἑν ᾖ μηδὲν συμ-
βάλλεται ὁ πράττων ἢ ὁ πάσχων, ibid. ; or, ἔοικε δὴ τὸ βίαιον εἶναι οῦ
ἔξωθεν ἡ ἁρχὴ μηδὲν συμβαλλομένου τοῦ βιασθέντος. ibid. ‘ Force
that makes involuntary is an external efficient, causing an aetion
without the concurrenee of the Volition of the agent or, as he may
be called, the patient.’

Although compulsion does not exclude Volition and Intention,
and consequently avoid a disposition, still, as we saw was the case
Ι with Error, it may entitle the victim to relies ε the terms, however,
in which the legislator promises relies imply that a Compulsory
disposition is originally valid and operative, and, in order to be
made null and void, requires to be rescinded: Ait praetor, Quod
metus causa gestum erit ratum non habeb0. D. 4, 2, 1. ‘ Disposi-
tions made under the influenee of intimidation shall be rescinded
(by Exception‚ Action, or Integral restitution).’ The term Gestum
or Negotium gestum is only applied to valid dispositions, and,
indeed, as was observed‚ an invalid or inoperative disposition would
not require to be rescinded by the supreme minister of justice.

The last general term that we propose to notice is Institution.
An Institution (e. g. Property, Obligation, Slavery, Tithe‚ Advow-
son) is the same thing as a Right or Obligatiou‚ but the one is
abstract, the other concrete. 'Phe relations of Institutione to Rights
and obligations may be elucidated by the syllogism we have already
indicated. An Institution is the major term A, as the predicate
of the major premiss, or as existing in the abstract sphere of the
law: a Right or Obligation is the same major term A, as the
predicate of the conclusion, or as existing in the concrete sphere of
fact. Or perhaps with equal propriety we may identify Institu-
tions (e. g. Alteration of property by tradition, Imposition of
obligation by written contract, Aequisition of an inheritance by
descent), with the middle term B as subject of the major premiss,
i. e. as having a permanent existence in the universal law: the
same middle term B as predicate of the minor premisses, i. e. as
