11. §5 65:79] ADQUISITIONES DOMINII N ATURALES. 205

by occupatiori. Dereliction, or renunciation of property, requires
both the intention to abandon it and an external action. Thus the
casting overboard of articles in a tempest to lighten a sbip is not
1161611611011, 86 111616 16 110 intention of abandoning tbe property in
the event 01 salvage, Inst. 2, 1, 48. Nor does the mere intention
of abandonment constitute dereliction of property without a throw·
ing away or removal or some other external act3 and herein dere-
liction of property differs from dereliction of possession, which does'
not require this second element. Differentia inter dominium et
possessionem haec est quod dominium nihilo minus ejus manet qui
dominus esse 11011 vult, possessio autem recedit ut quisque constituit
nolle possidere, Dig. 41, 2, 1⁷. ‘There is tbis difference between
dominion and possession, that dominion continues after the will to
own 1186 6686611, whereas possession 668666 with the cessation 01 1116
will to possess.'

ᾧ 68. Α1110113 wild animals (ferae naturae) a distinction is to be
drawn. In those of them that 816 half tamed (mansuefactae),
among which are mentioned deer, peacocks, pigeons‚ bees, property
is not limited by detention, as 111 other wild animals, but by animus
revertendi. A migrating swarm (examen) of bees, accordingly,
would only continue to belong to the owner of the hive as long 86
11 continues in his sight and is easy to recapture, 86 11 has no
intention of returning. In tame animals, 6. 3. (1036 01 36666, 1116
rights 01 the owner are not extinguished by their straying without
an intention to return.

ᾗ 70-78. The intimate conjunction 01 two things, so that they
are no longer separable and restorable to their former condition,
produces a transmutation of property. A separable junction (com-
mixtio), as when two flocks of sheep 816 intermingled, or when a
stone is set in a ring, or when two metals 816 soldered together
(plumbatum) or 816 fused but may be chemically separated, pro-
duces no change of property. In one case, however, namely, when
material has been used in building a house or cultivating a vine-
yard, although the property of the owner continues, the Twelve
Tables deprive him of the right to demand its separation by real
action (vindicatio), and only allow him to bring the action de tigno
juncto aedibus vel vineae and recover double the value.

An inseparable union sometimes produces co-ownership in the
whole (condominium or communio), sometimes the exclusive owner-
ship 01 0116 01 1116 parties (accessio).
