ξ 117. The necessity of using formal words in the institution of
an heir was abolished by a constitution of Constantine, Constantius,

. and Constans, Am. 339, Cod. 6, 23, 15.

As to the nomenclatnre employed in the following exposition of
Roman testamentary law, it must be observed that Heres corre-
sponds sometimes to the Heir, sometimes to the Devisee‚ sometimes
to the Executor, of English jurisprudence. In the language of
English jurisprudence, Heir denotes a successor to real estate, while
Executor denotes a successor to personal property. Again, Heir
denotes a successor to real estate by descent, Devisee denotes a
successor to real estate under a will. Accordingly, to avoid mis-
leading an English reader by salse associatious, in translating the
word Heres, Successor has generally been employed instead of Heir,
without, however, entirely renouncing the use of the shorter word,
which is often convenient from its relation to the indispensable
terms disinherit and disinheritance.

Devisee has generally been employed, in preference to Executor,
as a translation of scriptus heres, but it must then be stripped of
any reference to the distinction between property in money and
property in land. 'Phe word Executor is not available as a transla‘-
tion of heres. The Executor of English law, unless also a legatee,
holds a merely onerous office ; whereas the heres of Roman law was
always a beneficiary. The Roman heres, in fact, united the cba-
racters of the English executor and residuary legates: and the lex
Falcidia provided that the residue should always amount to at least
a fourth of the testator’s property.

Bequest (which in English law is related to personalty as devise
to realty) has been used in connection with legacicS, i. c. with dis-
positions in favour of legatarius as opposed to heres3 in favour,
that is, of a person who takes a single thing belonging to the
testator, not his familia, or the Universitas of his rights and
obligatione, or even a fraction of this Universitas.
