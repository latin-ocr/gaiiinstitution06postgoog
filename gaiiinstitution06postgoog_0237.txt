by postponing the consideration of obligatione, the remaining
branch of Res singulae, while we gain by exhausting the subject
of jus in rem before proceeding to the examination of jus in
personam. [Passive obligation means an obligation viewed from
the side of the debtor: Active obligation an obligation viewed
from the side of the creditor; otherwise called a Right]

We may remember that Rerum universitas, as well as Servitudes
and obligatione, was included by the Romans under the term Res
incorporalis, 2 ᾧ 14. The whole division of rights, however, into
Res corporalis and Res incorporalis is unsatisfactory ς for, as we
have already noticed, it was only from confusion of thought that

Dominion was held to be Res corporalis3 and all Rights are, really,
Rae incorporales.

legatorum ius, quo et ipso singulas
res adquirimuS, opportunius alio
loco referemus. Videamus itaque

vel ab intestato ad nos pertinent.

smum rights ; for, bequest, an-
other title whereby single rights are
acquired‚ will find a more suitable
place in a later portion of our
treatise. We proceed to the titles
whereby an AGGBEGATE of rights is
acquired.

ξ 98. If we become the successore,
civil or praetorian, of a person de-
ceased, or purchase the estate of an
insolvent, or adopt a person sui juris,
or receive a wife into our hand, the
whole estate of those persons is
transferred to us in an aggregate,

ances, whose mode of devolution is
twofold‚ according as a person dies
testate or intestate.

quisition by will.
