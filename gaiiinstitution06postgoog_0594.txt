the administration of criminal justice. Imperium mixtum may be
divided into two functions, (1) cognitio extraordinaria and (2)
actiones honorariae.

(1) Magistrates invested with imperium had the power of issuing

commands (jus decernendi) to which they enforced obedience by
fine (mulcta), distress (pignus) , and imprisonment, and, as a pre-
liminary to issuing a command (decretum), of summoning parties
before them (vocatio), by means of a lictor, and· conducting in person
an investigation of facts (causae cognitio). To these functione of
the praetor must be referred Restitutio in integrum, Missio in pos-
sessionem, and other proceedings which the praetor decided in
person without reference to a judex, a form of procedure which
finally superseded the ordo judiciorum or formulary system.
’ (2) But even of suits belonging to the ordo judiciorum, which
conformed, that is, to the principle of appointing a judex, a portion
must be referred to the praetor’s imperium. All the new actions,
unknown to the civil law, which the praetor invented in virtue of
the powers conferred by the law of uncertain date that introduced
the formulary system, the lex Aebutia; all fictitious actions and
actions in factum; in a word, all actiones honorariae, were emana-
tions of the praetorian imperium.

J urisdictio is sometimes used in a wider sense as equivalent to
officium jus dicentis: and then Lex and J urisdictio form an anti-
thesis similar to that which is formed by J urisdictio in the narrower
sense and Imperium: the antithesis, namely, of Legislator and
Administrator.

This antithesis is the principle of many of the divisione or classi-
fications in Roman jurisprudence and is expressed in various terms.

dicuntur aut honorariae) Dig. 44, 7, 25, 2, and Dig. 50, 16, 178, 3 ε
actiones quae ipso jure competunt opposed to actiones quae a
praetore dantur, 4 ᾗ 112: actiones quae ex legitimis et civilibus
causis descendunt opposed to actiones quas praetor ex sua juris-
dictione comparatas habet, Inst. 4, 6, 3: actio civilis and obligatio
civilis opposed to actio in factum a praetore danda, Dig. 2, 14, 7, 2 z
