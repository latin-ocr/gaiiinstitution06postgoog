coheirs were ratably augmented (accretio) just as, if originally
less than twelve ounces had been distributed, the expressed shares
of each would be ratably augmented so as to exhaust the inherit·
ance.

This rule, however, was modified by the leges caducariae, passed
chiefly to discourage celibacy‚ namely the lex J ulia de maritandis
ordinibuS, Aa). 4, and the lex Papia Poppaea, on marriage and suc-
cession, Aa). 9, in which the provisions of the lex Julia were in-
corporated, for which reason both laws are sometimes referred to as
lex J ulia et Papia.

Caducum is a devise or bequest, valid at Civil law, but vacated
by some particular statute: Quod quis sibi testamento relictum ita
ut jure civili capere possit, aliqua ex causa non ceperit, caducum
appellatur, veluti ceciderit ab eo: verbi gratia si coelibi vel Latino
J uniano legatum fuerit, nec intra dies centum vel coelebs legi
paruerit vel Latinus jus Quiritium consecutus sit: aut si ex parte
heres scriptus vel legatarius ante apertas tabulas decesserit vel
pereger factus sit, Ulpian‚ 17, 1. ‘A vacant devise or beqth is
one valid at civil law, but lapsed by some statute, such as a legacy
to a celibate or Latinus J unianuS, who fails within a hundred days
to comply with the law, or acquire full citizenship3 or a devise to
a coheir, or bequest to a legatee who dies or becomes an alien
before the will is opened.' [By the Civil law, unconditional devisas
and bequests vested (dies cedit) at the death of the testator (though
still defeasible by the failure of the will) 3 by the lex Papia Poppaea
not before the opening of the will.]

The leges caducan-iae, which fixed the conditione of caducity,
were aimed against the coelebs and the orbus. Coelebs is defined
to be an unmarried man between the age of twenty and sixty,
or an unmarried woman between the age of twenty and fifty.
Orbus is a man between fifty and sixty without children, natural
or adoptive.

A celibate could take nothing as heres extraneus or legatee3 an
orbus could only take half of the devise or bequest intended for
him. The devises thus vacant were allotted by the leges caducariac
in the first place to conjoint legatees of the same specific thing with
children3 in the second place to heirs with children3 in the third
place to other legatees with children3 and in last remainder to
the treasury (aerarium), 2 ᾗ 206. Caracalla, ΔΛ). 212-217, made them
