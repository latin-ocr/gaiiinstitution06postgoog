ABSTRAOT GONVENTION. 661

and Expensilatio contained the phantom of a money loan, the ana-
logon of the ‘ Value received ’ clause in a modern bill of exchange.
But this recognition was not universa13 for Stipulatio, whatever
may have been its original form, (-if derived from Stips, the word
suggests prepayment by the promisee: if connected with Stipes, it
merely signifies a binding formula—) in the shape with which we
are acquainted does not hint as a motive or cause of the advantage
conferred on the promisee any compensating burden that he has
previously borne.

The function of ABSTRAcr conventions, the purpose for which
they were invented, is obviously the facilitation of the Proof of
rights and duties by means of the simplification of their Title. The
more comprehensive the conditions of the 'Pitle to which a right is
annexed, the more complicated and troublesome will be its Proof.
'I'he causal factor of Formless contracts yields to a fraudulent debtor
at least as many positions where he can intrench himself as the
sequent factor. 'Phe necessity imposed on the plaintiff in an action
on a Formless contract of proving the existence of an adequate cause
doubles his burden of proof: Abstract conventions reduce this
burden to a fraction.

From the statement, p. 377, that a certain evidence of the con-
tractis an integral part of Formal but not of Formless contracts,
that Formal conventions‚ in other wordS, take up into their essence
a certain preappointed evidence, while Formless contracts are com-
plete independently of this, it might be inferred that the elements
of the Formal contracts were more complex than those of the Form-
less: but this would be an erroneous conclusion. The admission of
evidentiary matter into the essence of the Formal or Abstract con-
vention is more than counterbalanced by the exclusion of the causal
factor. The evidentiary matter is something visible and audible
and easy of proof and adjudication3 prescribed‚ indeed, for the very
reason that it is so' easy of proof and adj udication: whereas the
causal factor, involving a question of intention as well as of fact,
may furnish scope for endless subterfuge and controversy.

If the promisor has a just defence, this does not destroy the
validity of the Formal contract: does not prevent it from in the
first instance imposing an obligation: it only gives the debtor the
right to have such obligation reversed by means of a condictio
sine causa. This condictio, however, is only a personal remedy

against the promisee: if by means of Delegation the debt has been
