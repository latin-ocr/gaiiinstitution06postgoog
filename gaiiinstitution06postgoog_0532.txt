510 DE ACTIONIBUS. [lv. ξς 26-29.

latitation or keeping house rendered a defendant liable to manus
injectio, Such is the probable explanation of two fragments of the
Twelve Tables: Si in jus vocat, ni it, antestator, igitur em capito. . . .
Cui testimonium defuerit, is tertiis diebus ob portum obvagulatum
ito. ‘ On a service of summons to appear before the magistrate, if
the defendant refuse obedience, the plaintiff shall obtain attestation
of the fact, and then take him ΒΥ force. In default of such attesta-
tion (i.e. if the defendant avoid service by keeping out of the way)
the plaintiff on three marketedays shall stand before the defendant’s
door and wawl (loudly summon him to appear (?)‚ and after this
the defendant shall be liable to manus injectio).’ [Compare the
Hindoo custom of ‘sitting d'harna,' i.e. fasting at the door of a
debtor. Maine’s Early History of Institutions] .

, (3) Forfeiture of the condition of the solemn contract called
Nexum. This was a symbolic contract based on the fiction of a
money loan (mutuum), and on condemnation in a CondictiO, or,
possibly, on mere default in performance the debtor fell into the
position of a defendant (pro judicato) who has suffered judgment
on a money loan.

(4) Damnum injuria under lex Aquilia,

(5) and Legatum per damnationem. See 4 ᾧ 171, com.

With liability to Manus injectio for a quasi judgment debt we
may compare the arrest of an absconding debtor in the English law
by a writ of capias ad respondendum. As the Roman debtor had to
find a vindex or responsible representative, so the English debtor
must either remain in custody or put in bail, that is, find sureties
who will undertake that, if judgment is obtained against him, either
he shall surrender into custody, or shall pay the debt and costs
recovered, or that they themselves will pay them for him. The
Roman Vindex apparently became responsible for twice the amount

of the original debt.
