m. §5 77-81.] BONORUM VENDITIO. 347

’ an act of bankruptcy, and instead of suing out a writ of execution

the creditor may petition for adjudication of bankruptcy.

(2) When there is no previous judgment or admission of debt, a
debtor who absconde or secretes himself, with intent to defraud his
creditors, commite an act of bankruptcy in both systems of law.
In English law, for instance, if a debtor makes an appointment
with a creditor to meet at the debtor's place of business, and avoids
the meeting with the intention of delaying the creditor3 or if he
withdraws from his usual counting-house to a room upstairs, to
avoid the rightful and personal solicitation of his creditors for pay-
ment, he commite an act of bankruptcy. So in Roman law: Praetor
ait: In bona ejus qui judicio sistendi causa fidejussorem dedit, si
neque potestatem sui faciet neque defendetur, iri jubebo, Dig. 42,
4, 2. ‘The praetor says in the edict: If a man enter into a bond
with suretyship to appear at a trial, and neither appears in person
nor ΒΥ procurator, Ι will permit the plaintiff to seize his goods.'
Again: Praetor ait: Qui fraudationis causa latitabit, si boni viri
arbitratu non defendetur, ejus bona possideri vendique jubeb0, Dig.
42, 7, l. ‘ The praetor says in the edict: If a man secrete himself
with intent to defraud his creditore, and is not defended by a pro-
curator who gives security approved by an arbitrator, I will order
his property to be seized and sold.'

There is no adjudication of bankruptcy against a deceased debtor
in English law, but there may be a transfer of his universitas juris
as in Roman law; for creditors, in default of other administrators‚
may take out letters of administration against the estate of a
deceased debtor.

Cessio bonorum was introduced by a lex J ulia, enacted either by
Julius or Augustus Caesar, and if by the latter, in imitation of a
measure of the former which he himself has recorded. In the year
48 13.0. when Caesar was consul, credit having collapsed in con-
sequence of the civil war, debtors being generally insolvent, and
money having disappeared‚ Caesar allowed them to discharge their
obligations by the transfer of their estates, movable and immovable,
to their creditore, at the value, appraised ΒΥ arbitrators‚ which they
would have borne before the commencement of the war, De Bello

Civili, 3, 1. Cessio bonorum conferred three benefits on the debtor:
exemption from arrest and imprisonment‚ exemption from infamy

exemption of his aster-acquired property from liability beyond a
certain amount. Of these in order.
