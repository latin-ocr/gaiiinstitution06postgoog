tianum the Mala fide possessor was liable for collected fruits
(fructus perceptos), whether extant or consummi, from the inception
of his possession, but was not liable for those he neglected up to
Litis contestatio. After the Sc. J uventianum the Mala fide pos-
sessor was liable for the fruits he neglected, as well as for those he
collected, from the inception of his possession. After Litis con-
testatio he is further liable for fruits which he cannot collect but
which the plaintiff might have secured had be been in possession.

Thus aster Litis contestatio the liabilities of the Mala fide pos-
sessor are aggravated3 and the Bona fide possessor has the same
liabilities after Litis contestatio as the Mala fide possessor had be-
fore Litis contestatio ; being liable for fructus consumpti and fructus
neglecti as well as for fructus extantes.

The Bona fide possessor is not liable for fructus consumptae, be-
cause Separatio, as we have seen p. 203, makes fructus the property
of Bona fide possessor. He is liable, however, for fructus extantes,
because although he became proprietor of them by Separatio, yet he
is under an Obligation to convey them to the plaintiff who proved
himself to be the true proprietor of the principal or fruit-producing
object, · and it is a part of the officium judicis or official duty of
the judge to compel the defendant to perform this obligation‚ Inst.
4, 17, 2. Τ116 principal object itself requires no conveyance, being
already the property of the plaintiff.

(B) In personal actions belonging to the class called bonae fidei,
fruits must be restored from the date of Mora, or in the absence of
Mora, from the date of Litis contestatio,

In personal actions belonging to the class of condictions or stricti
juris actions originally no fruits were recoverable: at a later period
fruits were recoverable after Litis contestatio.

In personal actions, whether bonae fidei or stricti juris, brought
not for the original acquisition of property (consecutio) but for the
recovery of what has already been the plaintiff‘s property (repetitio),
all fruits are recoverable that are produced since the inception of the
obligation.

In personal actions bonae fidei, interest (usurae) is payable from the
date of Mora, or, in the absence of Mora, from Litis contestatio.

In condictions (stricti juris actiones), interest is not payable
from Mora but only from Litis contestatio: except that in condictio
certi, an aetion brought to recover a loan of money (mutuum), it
being necessary that the intentio should express the precise sum
