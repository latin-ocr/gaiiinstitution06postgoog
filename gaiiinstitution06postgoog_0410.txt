388 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [111. ἕξ 97-109.

might appear: for if the third person by subsequent ratification
made the contractor his negotiorum gestor, i. e. his representative
01 agent (procurator), the contract became valid. Savigny, Obli-
gation, § 59. We have already mentioned, ξ 100, that in J usti-
nian’s legislation a contractor could contract for a payment to or
by a third person, when that person was his own successor.

The controversy between the Sabinians and Proculeians is
decided in favour of the latter by J ustinian‚ who enacts that a
stipulation for payment of a sum to the promisee and a stranger
entitles the promisee to payment of half the sum and is void as
to the remainder, Inst. 3, 19, 4. In a Formless contract the
Sabinian doctrine still prevails, Dig. 18, 1, 64.

ᾧ 109. Τ116 age of puberty, as we have seen, was 14 for males,
12 for females. Before this period the child was called impubes:
up to the age of 7 116 was called infans. In the interval between
'7 and 14 he was described either as infantiae proximus 01 as pu-
bertati proximus. According to some commentatore the interval
was equally divided between these appellatione, so that from ’ἴ to
10} a boy was infantiae proximus, and from 10} to 14 pubertati
proximus. According to Savigny these names only covered the
space of a year measured from each limit, so that from 7 to 8 a
child was infanti proximus, from 13 to 14 puberi proximus, and
⁸ from 8 to 13 without any distinctive appellation.

The principa] peculiarity that results from the nature of verbal
and literal contracte and distinguishes them from other conventions
is, that other conventions 616 not legally valid unless the promisor
be shown to get a quid pro quo, that is, unless an adequate con-
sideration be proved: whereas verbal and literal contracte, secui-ing
by the solemnity of their formalities due deliberation 011 the part
of the contractors, 616 valid in favour of the promisee without
proof of consideration. ,

Although, however, the want of consideration did not absolutely in-
validate a stipulation, yet it constituted a counterpoising right of the
promisor which might be pleaded by the exceptio doli mali or non
numeratae pecuniae. Si quis sine causa ab aliquo fuerit stipulatus,
deinde ex ea stipulatione experiatur, exceptio utique doli mali ei
nocebit. Licet enim eo tempore quo stipulabatur nihil dolo 111610 ad·-
miserit, tamen dicendum est eum, cum litem contestatur, dolo facere
qui perseveret ex 66 stipulatione petere, Dig. 44, 4, 2, 3. ⁶ The absence
of consideration renders an action 011 a stipulation liable to be
