abolished, a writ of capias ad satisfaciendum, commanding him to
imprison the body of the debtor until satisfaction was made for the
debt. Aster a man's body was taken in execution, no other process
could be sued out against his lands or his goods, and aster his lands
were seized by elegit, his body could not be taken, but if part
only of the debt was levied on a fieri facias, the creditor might
have a capias ad satisfaciendum for the residue. So that body and
goods might be taken in execution, or land and goods, but not both
body and land. None of these remedieS, we may observe‚ includes
the sale of the debtor’s land. In bankruptcy, on the contrary, the
whole real as well as personal estate of the debtor is transferred to
the creditors' trustee‚ to be sold or otherwise disposed of, at the
discretion of the creditore».

We find a corresponding difference between execution and bank-
ruptcy in Roman law, at all events in its later period. The pro-
ceeding in an ordinary execution, as opposed to proceedings in
insolvency‚ was called pignoris capio, Dig. 4, 2, 1. A portion of
the debtor's estate was seized, not by the plaintiff, as in the old
legis actio called pignoris capio, but by public officers (the officiales,
viatores, apparitores, executores of the magistrate), and, after being
detained for two months to enforce payment by way of pledge, was
sold in satisfaction of the debt. Movables were to be seized and
sold in the first instance, but, if these were insufficient, lands might
be seized and sold, Dig. 42, 1, 15. If a purchaser could not be
found the property might be delivered to the creditor at an ap·
praisement, ibid. In pignoris capio there was only a conveyance
of a portion of the debtor’s estate, there was no transfer of his juris
universitas as in insolvency.

We have said that it was necessary to distinguish proceedings
in bankruptcy from execution in a personal action. There is not
the same danger of confusion between bankruptcy and execution in
a real aetion. The judgment in a real action declares the plaintiff
proprietor, if it passes in his favour, and possession of the thing in
dispute is delivered to him by the sovereign power. The judgment
in a personal action only declares the plaintiff creditor, and some
payment or conveyance has still to he performed by the debtor.

As the levy of an execution by seizure and sale of a trader's
goods for a debt of fifty pounds is an act of bankruptcy, it is
evident that in English law execution will often involve bank-
ruptcy 3 that is to say, when one creditor has obtained payment of
