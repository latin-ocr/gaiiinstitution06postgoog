PREFACE ΤΟ SECOND EDITION.

IN the year 1816, Niebuhr noticed in the library of the Cathedral
Chapter at Verona a manuscript in which certain compositione of
Saint J erome had been written over some prior writings, which in
certain places had themselves been superposed on some still earlier
inscription. On communication with Von Savigny, Niebuhr came
to the conclusion that the lowest or earliest inscription was an
elementary treatise on Roman Law by Gaius, a treatise hitherto

line thirty-nine letters ; but sometimes as many as forty-five. On
sixty pages, or about a fourth of the whole, the codex is doubly
palimpsest, i. e. there are three inscriptions on the parchment.
About a tenth of the whole is lost or completely illegible, but part
of this may b'e restored from J ustinian’s Institutes, or from other
sources 3 accordingly, of the whole Institutione about one thirteenth

From the style of the handwriting the MS. is judged to be older
than J ustinian or the sixth century aster Christ3 but probably did
