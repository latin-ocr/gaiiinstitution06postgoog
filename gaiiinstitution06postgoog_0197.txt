immunity from both kinds of direct taxation, jugatio humana and
jugatio terrena. Italy, however, with the exception of the district
about Rome, was subject to certain payments in kind (annona),
whence its division into Italia annonaria and Italia urbicaria.
According to some, Italia urbicaria contributed to the use of the
metropolis payments similar to those which Italia annonaria paid
to the· imperial household. Moreover, to compensate for her im-
munity from other taxation, Italy paid 5 per cent. on all testa-
mentary successions (vicesima hereditatum) and 5 per cent. on
the value of all manumitted slaves, Livy, 7, 16. Under Diocletian
Italy lost her immunities and was reduced to the condition of a

province. Savigny, Vermischte Schriften, 16.

originally no jurisdiction to preside over legis actio, but this was
afterwards conferred upon them, Tac. Ann. 12, 60.

delivery of possession.

ξ 29. Urban servitudes can only
be created· by surrender in a fic-
titious vindication; rustic servi·
tudes may either be acquired by
