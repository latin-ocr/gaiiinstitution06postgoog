. 442 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [111. ἕξ ies-131.

AgeriuS, spopondit Numerius Negidius, Item ex diverso Numerius
Negidius interrogavit Aulum Agerium : Quicquid tibi hodierno die
per Aquilianam stipulationem spopondi, id omne habesne acceptum?
Respondit Aulus Agerius ε Habeo acceptumque tuli, Inst. 3, 29, 2.
‘ There is a stipulation called Aquiliam, whereby all obligations are
transmuted into a verbal one, and forthwith discharged by accepti-
lation. For the Aquilian stipulation operates a novation of all
pre-existing debts, and is thus expressed: “ Whatever thing, on
whatever title, thou art or shalt be bound to convey to me or to
perform for me now or hereafter, absolutely or conditionally;
whatever thing I have or shall have an action, personal, real, or
extraordinary, against thee to recover3 whatever thing of mine
thou hast, detainest‚ possessest, hast possessed, or hast fraudulently
parted with possession of 3 whatever sum is the value of all these
thingS, that sum dost thou to pay me promise ?'' so asks Aulus
Agerius, and Numerius Negidius answers: “I promise.'' Then
Numerius Negidius asks of Aulus Agerius: “ Whatever I have
promised thee to-day by the Aquilian stipulation, hast thou received
it all in full?” and Aulus Agerius answers: “ I have, and have
given thee my release.”'

The narrative form (stipulatus est, spopondit, interrogavit) in
which the transaction is expressed by J usfinian, properly belongs,
not to the stipulation and acceptilation‚ but to the written memo-
randum (cautio) in which they are recorded.

ᾧ 172. It was subsequently an established doctrine that a partial
release by acceptilation was valid, Dig. 46, 4, 13.

ᾧ 174. The translation follows the conjectural reading of
Lachmann: Quod ego tibi tot milibus eo nomine vel eo judicio
damnatus sum, eos nummos solvo liberoque hoc aere aeneaque
libra. Hanc ubi libram primam postremam serii, nihil de lege jure
obligatur.

The words prima postrema are found in the form of striking
a treaty (foedus ferire) given by Livy, 1, 24: Legibus deinde
recitatiS, Audi, inquit, J upiter3 audi, pater patrate populi Albani;
audi tu, populus Albanus3 ut illa palam prima postrema ex illis
tabulis cerave recitata sunt sine dolo ma10, utique ea hic hodie
rectissime intellecta sunt, illis legibus populus Romanus prior non
deficiet. Si prior defexit publico 'consilio dolo malO, tu illo die,
Jupiter, populum Romanum sic ferito ut ego hune porcum hic
hodie feriam: tantoque magis ferito quanto magis potes pollesque.
