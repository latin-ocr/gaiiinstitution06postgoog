paid, or security is given for the price, or credit is given *without
security.’ Venditae vero et traditae res non aliter emptori acquir-
untur quam si is venditori pretium solverit, vel alio modo ei satis-
fecerit, velut expromissore aut pignore dato . . . sed si is qui vendidit
fidem emptoris secutus fuerit, dicendum est statim rem emptoris
fieri, Inst. 2, 1, 41. ⁶ Sale and delivery do not pass property, unless
the vendee pays the price, or gives the vendor security3 for instance,
by a guarantor discharging the vendes, or by mortgage. If, how-
ever, the sale is on credit, ownership immediately pasees?

By English law, if the contract is for the sale of srsscnnc goods,
ready for delivery, there is no distinction between the jus in personam
and the jus in rem; the contract is complete and the property
pasees at one and the same moment.

If the sale is on credit, property passes immediately upon the
striking of the bargain or understanding as to terms, even before
delivery of the goodS. > Γ, .

If the sale is for ready money, there must be a delivery er tender of Ἀ .. ,A
the whole of the goods or price, or delivery and acceptance of part
of the goods or price, before there is any contract, and at the same
moment the property 1s transmuted from the vendor to the vendes.

If the contract is not for the purchase of {pecific gOOdS, but of
goods of a certain nature or class, there arises a distinction between
property and obligation3 for, though the contract is complete,
no property passes until the particular goods are ascertained by
delivery.

In the sale of land the equitable estate is conveyed by the contract
to convey, when perfected by the payment of the purchase-money,
and without notice to the party in whom the legal estate is vested:
the legal estate is only passed by the subsequent deed. Formerly the
decd was a Feoffment which was inoperative without livery of seisin,
that is, delivery of possession3 but now the deed of Grant passes
property without delivery of possession. The assignment of an
equitable interest in personal estate is not perfect, as against an
assignee for valuable consideration, without notice to the trustes.

By the Code Napoleon delivery is requisite for the transfer of
property in movableS‚ but property in immovables is transferred as
soon as the contract is complete.

By Roman law, the goods are at the risks of the purchaser as
soon as the contract is complete, and before the property is trans-
muted. The formula, res perit domin0, therefore, does not apply to 5 4
