m. ξς 92-96.] FORMAL oonAcT. 377

The facts called 'I'itles, whether they confer a jus in rem or a
jus in personam, are never absolutely elementary,—are always
decomposable into a bundle of more elementary facts. Never-
theless, and with this reservation, Titles may be divided into such as
are comparatively simple, and such as are comparatively complex.

'Phe bundle of facts composing a comparatively complex 'Pitle
can usually be divided into two portions, one of which may be
called principal or essential, the other secondary or adventitious.

For instance, in the bundle of facts composing an alienation, or
creating a jus in rem, the essential or principal portion is the free
will and intention of the alienor to divest himself of a right and
invest the alienee with it, and the acceptance of the proffered right
by the alienee: the accessory and adventitious portion is the signi-
fication of these intentione by the execution of a certain written
instrument or deed, and their completion by the solemn delivery
and acceptance of seisin or possession.

A Formal Disposition is one for which, under pain of nullification,
the necessary or exclusively valid form of expression or mani-

· festation of intention is prescribed by the legislator. A Formless

Disposition is one where the individual is free to choose the form
of expressing, or mode of manifesting, his intention.

These accessory formalities and solemnities are ancillary to the
efflential purpose of the transaction, being destined partly to pre-
vent rash and inconsiderate engagements‚ partly to furnish evidence
and proof of the convention or principa] part of the transaction.

Indeed, the accessory portion of the Title may contain an element
still more remotely and casually connected with the principal
transaction, such as the stamp affixed to the document executed
by the parties. 'Phe stamp in no way contributes to the purpose
and intention of the parties, but the legislator makes it necessary
to the validity of the transaction from financial motives‚ for the
sake, namely, of the public revenue.

Setting aside this purely arbitrary addition to the Title, we may
say that the function of the Title is not only to be the antecedent
to which the law annexes as a consequent a certain right or obliga-
tion, but also to be a sign, badge, or manifestation, to denote to the
world the person in whom a right has vested, or on whom au
obligation has become incumbent.

The peculim· characteristic of Formal, that is to say, Verbal and
Literal contracts, is this: evidentiary solemnities compose in these
