immediate power of a testator, whether (A) children or (B) grand·
children: to remoter descendente analogous principles will apply.

(A) Children are either

(a) Veritably afterborn, that is to say born aster their father has
made his will, whether after their father’s decease, in which case
the civil law treated them as certae personae, or in their father's
lifetime, in which ease they form a subdivision of Velleiani primi
capitis:

(b) Or quasi-afterborn (loco postumorum), i. e. quasi-sons or quasi-
daughters by adrogatio, adoptio, ‚legitimatim in manum conventio.

- (c) Another quasi-afterborn is the child who falls under the
immediate power of his soldier father, that is, becomes his suus
heres, in consequence of the death of his grandfather, in whose
power he previously was, aster his father has made a soldier's
will. D. 28, 2, 28, 1.

(Β) Afterborn grandchildren who, as sels-successore to their grand-
father, require institution or disinheritance in his will fall into four
classes, differentiated by the order of priority in which certain
events occur, as hereunder indicated:

Possum Aqmmm,

Will of grandfather: Death of father: Death of grandfather:
Birth of grandchild.

{will of grandfather: Death of father :J Birth of grandchild:

Poswm Savum,

Win of grandfather: Birth of grandchild: Death of father:
Death of grandfather.

Posi-mu Virunum Sscuum Cffms,

Birth of grandchild: ‚will of grandfather: Death of father:·

-d

Death of grandfather.

The two last cases depend on the principle of successio. The
grandchild is at birth in the power of bis grandfather, but is
not his suus heres, so long as there is an intervening ascendant—
the father—in the same power. On the death of the intervening
ascendant the grandchild is said to succeed to his place, and be-
comes by such succession suus heres to his grandfather. Van·

The afterborn stranger, though incapable at civil law of being
appointed heir (ξ 242), was relieved by the praetor who gave him
