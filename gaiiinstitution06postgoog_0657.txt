that he would not again attempt to build before he established 1118
own jus aedificandi, 01 disproved A's jus prohibendi, as plaintiff in
8 suit. This would be 30110 negatoria of 3 3118 altius non tollendi,
if he denied that he was ever under 3 servitude to the tenement of
A: actio confessoris of jus altius tollendi, if he affirmed that the
servitude was extinguished by usucapio libertatis, Dig. 39, 1, 15:
or some other actio confessoris if 118 claimed 3 dominant servitude
over the tenement of A.

Pending disputes on 1110388 18131138 10 land a similar function
was discharged by the interdictum Quod vi aut clam. On a pro-
hibitio from 3 neighbour, who might have 3 1831 right or be 3
mere lessee, prohibitus was obliged to desist from any agricul-
tural innovation (ploughing up pasture, cutting trees, polluting
streame, &c.) until 118 offered security (satisdatio judicatum solvi)
in any suit in which he might be made defendant, Dig. 43, 24,
3, 5; or proved his jus faciendi, or 13 other words, disproved his
neighbour’s jus prohibendi, as plaintiff in some real action or in
Uti possidetiS, Dig. 43, 17, 3, 2. If he persisted in his operation in
spite of the prohibitio, the interdictum Quod vi aut clam compelled
him to efface it and to pay damages for the harm it occasioned.

The interdicte which Gaius calls double are called by Ulpian
mixed. Mixtae sunt 30110388, 13 quibus uterque actor est, utputa
finium regundorum, familiae erciscundae, communi dividundo, inter-
dictum Uti possidetiS‚ Utrnbi, Dig. 44, 7, 37, 1. ‘ Mixed actions
are those wherein each party is both plaintiff and defendant, as the
action for tracing boundarieS, for partition of an inheritance, for
dissolution of joint ownership, and the interdicta Uti possidetis and
Utrubi.’ The. effect of this duplicity or mixture of characters
was that the plaintiff, 38 11811 38 1118 defendant, was liable to ‘con-
demnation and absolution. According to J ustinian, the three
personal actions just named are called Mixed because they involve
questions both of property and obligation, Mixtam causam obtinere
videntur, tam in rem quam in personam, Inst. 4, 6, 20. Another
effect of the duplicity of thesdnterdicts was, 88 118 shall presently see,
to increase the number of stipulatione in the proceeding by sponsio.

In the system of statute-process (18818 30110), Vindicatio was 3
judicium duplex. The contention of the defendant was not merely
a negation of ¹the plaintiff’s claim, but also 33 affirmation of the
defendant's claim, 3 contravindication. Praetor interrogat eum
qui cedit an contravindicet‚ 1, ᾧ 24. It was not necesoery that,
