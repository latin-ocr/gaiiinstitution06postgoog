to administer his own affairs, and
the same rule obtains in other
nations, as we have already men-
tioned.

§ 198. Under similar circum-
stances the president of a province
appoints a curator by the constitu-
tion of Marcus Aurelius,

DE: SATISDATIONE TUTORUM VEL CURATORUM.

ξ 199. Ne tamen et pupillorum
et eorum qui in curatione sunt
negotia a tutoribus curatoribusque
consumantur aut deminuuntur, cu-
rat praetor, ut et tutores et curato-
res eo nomine satisdent.

§20st Set hoc non est perpe·
tuum. nam et tutores testamento
dati satisdare non coguntur, quia
fides eorum et diligentia ab ipso
testatore probata est3 ec curatores
ad quos non e lege curatio pertinet,
set qui vel a consule vel a praetore
vel a praeside provinciae dantur,
plerumque non coguntur satisdare,
scilicet quia satis idonei electi sunt.

§.199 To protect wards aud
minors from the destruction or
waste of their property by guar-
dians and curators, it is the func-
tion of the praetor to require guar-
diane and curators to give security
for due administration.

§200. But this is not without
exception, for testamentary guar-
dians are not compelled to give
security, as their integrity and vigi-
lance have been approved by the
testator· , aud curators who have
not been appointed by any statute,
but by the nomination of a consul
or praetor or president of a pro-
vince, are generally not required to
give security, their selection being
deemed sufficient evidence of their
trustworthiness.

In English jurisprudence there is no distinction corresponding to

that between tutor and curator, infant (impubes) and minor (ado-
lescens). Infant and minor are in English synonymous: guardian-
ship continues to the attainment of majority, i. e. to the comple-
tion of 21 years of age ; and after that the young of both sexes are
considered to· be capable of taking care of themselves, and are
free from further control. At Rome wardship (tutela) ceased

at the age of 14 for males and 12 for females, ages at which
the young manifestly continue to stand in need of guidance and

protection.

Such protection was provided for them partly by two statuteS,
partly by praetorian legislation. (1) The lex Plaetoria was as
old as Plautus, who makes a youth exclaim: 'Pum lex me perdit
quinavicenaria3 metuunt credere omneS, Pseudolus, l, 3, 69. ‘ The ,
statute with its five and twenty years prevents my getting credit.'
