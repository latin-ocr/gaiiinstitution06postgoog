Adrogation, or the adoption of an independent person (pater-
familias), reducing him to a dependent status (filiusfamilias), was
a legislative act of the Comitia Curiata3 but though, as repre-
senting the people, this assembly was legally omnipotent‚ it was
unconstitutional to deprive a person either of the franchise or of
domestic independence without his own consent. We learn from
Cicero the formula by which this assent was ascertained ε Sed quum
hoc juris a majoribus proditum sit ut nemo civis Romanus aut
libertatem (Mommsen conjectures: sui potestatem, but this in
popular language may have been included under libertatem) aut
civitatem possit amittere, nisi ipse auctor factus sit, quod tu ipse
potuisti in tua eausa discere: credo enim, quanquam in ista adop-
tione legitime factum est nihil, tamen te esse interrogatum, auctorne
esses, ut in te P. Fonteius vitae necisque potestatem haberet ut in
filio—quaero si aut negasses aut tacuisses, si tamen id triginta
curiae jussissent, num id jussum esset ratum? De Domo, 29. ‘ As
it is an immemorial rule of law that no citizen of Rome shall be
deprived of independence or the franchise against his will, as you
have had occasion of learning by your own-experience, for I suppose
that, illegal as your adrogation was in all points, you at least were
asked whether you consented to become subject to the adrogator's
⁴ power of life and death as if you were his son ;-if you had opposed
or been silent, and the thirty Curiae had nevertheless passed the law,
tell me, would their enactment have had any binding force ?' 'Phe
form in which the law was proposed to the legislative assembly is
given by Gellius: Adrogantur hi qui, cum sui juris sunt, in alienam
sese potestatem tradunt ejusque rei ipsi auctores fiunt. Sed adro-
gationes non temere nec inexplorate committuntur: nam comitia,
arbitris pontificibus, praebentur, quae curiata appellantur, aetasque
ejus qui adrogare vult, an liberis potius gignundis idonea sit, bona-
que ejus qui adrogatur ne insidiose adpetita sint, consideratur, jusque
jurandum a Q. Mucio, pontifice maximo, conceptum dicitur, quod
in adrogando juraretur ..... Adrogatio autem dicta quia genus hoc
in alienam familiam transitus per populi rogationem fit. Ejus
rogationis verba haec sunt. Velitis, jubeatis, uti L. Valerius
L. Titio tam jure legeque filius siet, quam si ex eo patre matreque
