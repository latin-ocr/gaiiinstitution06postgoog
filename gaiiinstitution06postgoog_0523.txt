the praetor on the thirtieth ‘day to
receive a judge. The name is now
applied with less propriety to a
personal action by which we 3116 for
a transfer of property, for notice
forms no pait of the procedure.

ξ 19. This form of statute-process
was created by the lex Silia and lex
Calpurnia, being prescribed by the
lex Silia for the recovery of a cer-
tain sum, and extended by the lex
Calpurnia to the recovery of a cer-
tain thing.

§ 20. Why a new action was ,

needed, when transfer of property
could be demanded either by Sacra-
mentum or by J udicis postulatio, is
canvassed.

After eompleting 1113 account of Sacramentum, Gaius proceeded
to explain the nature of J 11111613 postulati& Of its process we have
a fragment 16 the formula, Te, Praetor, judicem arbitrumve postulo
uti des, ‘I pray you, Praetor, to appoint an arbiter or judge. ’ It
was apparently the 111-61011116 of actions 63 fide bona, that 13, of
actions which required an equitable balancing of opposite claims,
and an assessment by the judex of the damages, if any, due to the

plaintiff. The actions Finium regundorum, Familiae herciscundae, ¹
Aquae pluviae arcendae, Vindiciae falsae, which are mentioned in ·

the Twelve Τ611163, appear to have been tried by an arbiter or
arbiters, that 13, to 11616 been forms of J 11111613 postulatio·

'Phe condictio was unknown to the Twelve Tables, having been
created by the lex Silia about Β. 6. 244, 6611 extended by the 163
Calpurnia about Β. 6. 234. Its distinctive feature appears to have
been the 31106310 6611 restipulatio, § 13, a 116861 01 verbal contract
conditioned for the forfeiture by the vanquished party of one third
of the sum in dispute, in addition, on the part of the defendant, to
the original debt. The stake or penalty 13 6611611 by Cicero legitima

petitur per judicem, in qua legitimae partis sponsio facta est, Pro
RosciO, 4, 5: whence we may infer that it was fixed by the lex
Silia, the statute which created the procedure by condietiO.

At this period the Sacramentum would be practically confined 1ο
