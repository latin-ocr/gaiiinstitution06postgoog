1v. ξς 171-187.] LIBELLARY PROCEDURE. 657

summons of the defendant by the plaintiff, was superseded by
the evocatiO, summons of the defendant: ΒΥ the magistrate through
his lichbedience to this summons was compelled ΒΥ a fine
of which we have the formula in Gellius: M. Terentius quando
citatus neque respondit neque excusatus est, ego ei unum ovem
multam dico, 11, 1. ‘ As M. Terentius on citation has neither
answered nor been excused, I fine him in a single sheep.' If
the defendant continued contumacious he was summoned to appear
by three proclamatione (edicta) at intervals of ten days, and finally

an edictum peremptorium was issued in which the magistrate

threatened to hear and decide the case in his absence, in default
of his appearance, which was done, if he continued disobedient,
Dig. 5, 1, 68.

Procedure before a judex was properly called actio, before the
praetor, persecutio. Persecutionis verbo extraordinarias persecu-
tiones puto contineri, utputa fideicommissorum, et si quae aliae
sunt quac non habent juris ordinarii executionem, Dig. 50, 16,
178, 2. ‘ Persecutio is the proper name for proceedings before
the praetor, as in trusts and other claims which are not triable
by an ordinary judex.'

The Libellary procedure which existed in the time of J ustinian ,
having superseded the Formulary procedure, was essentially the
same as cognitio extraordinaria. Instead of the summons before
the praetor (in jus vocatio) and notice of the action which the
plaintiff meant to bring (editio actionis) with which the Formulary ,
procedure commenced, Libellary procedure began with libellus
conventionis and commonitio, The libellus conventionis was a

 

writing addressed to the court, signed by the plaintiffi stating his
cause of action, and binding himself to prosecute the suit to judg-
ment: it was a form of suing out a writ or summons. Thereupon
followed an interlocutio of the court, that is, a commonitio, cor-
responding to the original writ, addressed to the defendant and
served on him, not by the plaintiff but by an officer of the court
(executor) along with the libellus. The defendant then either gave
cautio jndicio sisti, security for his appearance in jure for the de-
finitive appointment of the trial (judicio ordinando), or was liable to
incarceration.

Gaius has given us no information concerning Appeal. Under
the republic we hear of no right of Appeal in civil suits: it appears
however with the empire, and indeed with the first emperor. 'Phe
