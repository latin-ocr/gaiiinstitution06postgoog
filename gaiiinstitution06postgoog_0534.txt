512 DE Aomomssus: [w. ξς 26-29.

Pignoris capio in the older system was a remedy allowed in cases
of a public character, that is, in claims relating to military service,
to religion, or to the revenue. In the first case the remedy was
established by custom‚ that is, was anterior to the Twelve Tables; in
the second case it was given by the Twelve Tables3 in the third
case it was created by law subsequent to the Twelve Tables.

We have mention of the aes bordarium, ξ 27, in Livy's account
of the Servian constitution: Ad equos emendos dena millia aeris
ex publico data et, quibus equos alerent, viduae attributae, quae
bina millia aeris in singulos annos penderent, Livy l, 43. ‘ Each
soldier received ten thousand asses for the purchase of a horse,
and for its maintenance a widow was assigned, who was bound
to pay two thousand asses a year!

The institution appears to have been transplanted from Greece.
Cicero mentions it as in force at Corinth: Deinde equitatum ad
hunc morem constituit, qni usque adhuc est. retentus. Atque
etiam Corinthios video publicis equis assignandis et alendis or·
borum et viduarum tributis fuisse quondam diligentes, De Re-
publica, 2, 20. ‘ Tarquinius Priscus instituted the present organi-
zation of the cavalry. At Corinth, whence he came, there was
a practice of allotting horses at the public expense aud taxing
the childless aud widows for their maintenanoe.' The private
persons thus appointed military paymasters appear to bave been
called tribuni aerarii, Gellius 7, 10. In later times soldiers were
paid by the Quaestors from the public treasury.

We bave something similar in the Laws of Plato: περὶ δὲ . . . .
λειτουργιῶν, ὁπόσα περὶ θυσίας εἰρηνικῆς ἢ πολεμικῶν εἰσφορῶν εἵνεκα,
πάντων τῶν τοιούτων τὴν πρώτην ἀνάγκην ἰατὴν εἶναι τῆς ζημίας τοῖς
[δὲ] μὴ πειθομένοις, ἐνεχυρασίαν τούτοις οἷς ἂν πόλις ἅμα καὶ νόμος εἰσ·
πράττειν προστάττῃ, τῶν δὲ ἀπειθούντων ταῖς ἐνεχυρασίαις πρᾶσιν τῶν
ἐνεχύρων εἶναι, τὸ δὲ νόμισμα γίγνεσθαι τῇ πόλει, LaWS, 12, 4. ‘If
a public duty relating to religion or war is unperformed, the first
stage of coustraint shall be defeasible of penality by submission of
the defaulter‚ and his goods shall be merely taken in distress by the
lawfully appointed official; but if he continue contumacious, the
distre-ss shall be sold and the proceeds shall be confiscated.'

ξ 28. Raising money for a sacrifice by letting out a bea-st of
burden seems such an exceptional circumstance that we may con-
jecture it was only a fictiticus averment permitted for the purpose
of grounding an action. Compare the fictitious averment, permitted
