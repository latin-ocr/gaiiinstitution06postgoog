(3) He sometimes gave possession adverse to rights which the
law had conferred on other persons, that is, he contradicted or
corrected the law3 e. g. he gave juxta-tabular possession to the
devisee under a will invalid at Civil law, from want of mancipation
or nuncupation, 2 ᾧ 149. He gave juxta-tabular possession to the
afterborn stranger (postumus alienus), Inst. 3, 9, pr. who, as an
uncertain person, could not be instituted by the Civil law, 2 ᾧ 2423
and he gave contra-tabular possession to the emancipated child
passed over in silence by a testator, 2 ᾧ 135.

As in the two latter functions of supplementing and correcting
the law, the praetor did what is elsewhere performed by courts of
equity‚ we have sometimes translated the contrasted terms heres and'
bonorum possessor by the terms ‘legal successor ’ and ‘ equitable
successor.'

The equitable or praetorian successor could not sue or be sued
by the direct actions of the Civil law, but only by fictitious actione,
4 ᾧ 34. The claim of a succession founded on a title at Civil law
was called hereditatis petiti03 a claim founded on a purely prae·
torian title, e. g. cognatim, was pursued by the Interdict Quorum
bonorum, or, in the late& period, by possessoris. hereditatis petitio,
Dig. 5, 5, 1. Such at least is Savigny's view, who makes no
essential difference between the Interdict Quorum bonorum and
Possessoria hereditatis petitio. According to Vangerow‚ ᾧ 509, the
Interdict was confined to the provisional purpose of obtaining
Possession: and Possessoria hereditatis petitio was the means of
claiming the inheritance when a claimant (e. g. cognatus or emanci-
patus) had a merely praetorian title; as Hereditatis petitio was
the means of claiming the civil inheritance. Accordingly the
Interdict could not be brought, like Hereditatis petitio, against
debtors to the inheritance3 but only against possessors of corporeal
hereditaments. Interdicto Quorum bonorum debitores hereditarii
non tenentur, sed tantum corporum possessores, Dig. 4, 3, 2, 2.
Debtors would be pursued by Possessoria hereditatis petitio, if they
disputed the creditor’s right of succession3 by actiones fictitiae,
. 4 ᾧ 34, if this was admitted.

cessively granted bonorum possessio in intestacy were as follow ι
