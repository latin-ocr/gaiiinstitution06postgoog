the debits and credits ought to correspond with and explain the
metallic contente of the cash-box or arca at the end of the month
or year. This correspondence or agreement would be destroyed by
the introduction of Fictitious loans (expensilatio) into the accounts,
unless every such entry to the credit of the cashier or chest was
neutralized and cancelled by a crosa or opposite entry, of an equally
fictitious character, to the debit of the chest or caehier. But if
this device was adopted the balance of the book would coincide
with the actual contents of the chest3 and the fictitious entries
would be called Transcriptitia because they were always double:
because aeoh was always accompanied by its shadow across the
Pago·

In the time of J ustinian both of the modes of Expensilatio, pro-
perly confined to Roman citizens, had become obsolete3 but another
form of Literal contract, the S yngrapha or Chirographum, avail-
able where either of the parties was an alien, was still in use.
Syngrapha and chirographum, apparently, are synonymouS, and ἶ
signify any contract in writing, such contract in Greece being
always ground to support an action, whatever its subject or form.

Τ110 desuetude of Nomina transcriptitia was probably due to the
invention of consumma, a Consensua] contract‚ which instead of
converting like Expensilatio an equitable obligation into an obli-
gation of jus strictum, superadded a civil obligation to a previous
obligation, whether equitable or civil [Ubi quis pro alio constituit
se soluturum, adhuc is pro quo constituit obligatus manet, Dig. 13,

5, 28] 3 and which with its excessively penal sponsio, 4 ᾖ 171, gave , .,

1110 creditor even a more effective remedy than the action on
Expensilatio (Condictio for pecunia certa credita).

Arcarium nomen was the record, not of a fictitious loan, like
nomen transcripticium, but of the counting out of money from the
cash-box (arca), that 13, of a genuine loan, and waS, accordingly, a
memorandum of a Real obligation.

Τ110 coexistence of Nomina Arcaria with Nomina Transcriptitia
shows that entry in a Ledger did not operate a novation and con·
vert a debt into a ledger debt, unless such effect was intended.

A stipulatio, unlike the entry in the 3001001 or ledger, was not
an invariable accompaniment of an advance of money (mutui dati0,
annumeratio); and, when it was employed simultaneously with
annumeratio, unlike expensilatiO, it always constituted the sole con-.-
tract: there were not two contracts, a Real contract and a Verbal
