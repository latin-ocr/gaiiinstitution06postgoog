111. ἕξ 97-109.] PAYMENT To A THIRD PERSON. 385

Conditions annexed to contracte have the· following difference
from conditione annexed to testamentary dispositione and dis-
positione translative of dominion. Conditions annexed to contract
are retroactive: the obligation determined by their fulfilment
relates backward and dates from the date of the contract. Con-
ditions annexed to legacy or to alienation are not retroactive: the
obligation or ownership thereby conferred only dates from the
fulfilment of the condition.

We have seen that conditions were excluded from Expensilatio
or Literal contract: it was their admissibility in Stipulatio that
made the latter, unlike Expensilatio‚ a generic or universal form
of contract: a contract equally applicable whatever the object that
the contractors desired to secure. Primitive jurisprudence only
recognized stipulations whose object was a datio or conveyance
of property3 not stipulations whose object was a factio or non-
1661310, 60166 011161 kind of performance or forbearance. But when
facere or non facere was allowed to form the Condition of an obli-
gation whose object was a dare, that is, when the payment of
a penal sum could be made contingent on the non-performance
or performance of a certain act, it became possible to stipulate,
virtually or indirectly at least, for factio or non-factio as well as

ᾧ 100. Α6 130 1116 rights conferred or obligations imposed by
a contract on third persons not parties to the contract Paulus lays
down the following principle: Quaecunque gerimus, cum ex nostro
contractu originem trahunt, nisi ex nostra persona obligationis
initium sumant, inanem actum nostrum efficiunt: et ideo neque
stipulari neque emere vendere contrahere, ut alter suo nomine recte
agat, possumne, Dig. 44, 7, 11, 1.6. 16 every contract where the
apparent contractors are the real contractors, i. e. are not agents
but principale, the right created by the contract must primarily
vest, if the contract is to be valid, in the promisee himself ; and
the obligation in the promisor himself. This rule is evidently
not violated if the promisee associates to himself his heir, i. e.
contracte for some right to himself and heir: Suae personae ad-
jungere quis heredis personam potest, Dig. 45, 1, 38, 14: but it is
violated if the promisee contracte for some right to vest exclusively
in his heir, or, as expressed in this paragraph, for some performanoe
post mortem suam. Such contracts accordingly were void, whether
they belonged to the civil or the gentile code, ᾧ 158. Τ1116 1611 10
