tions by payment of a dividend of ten shillings in the pound, or,
failing this, by a resolution of his creditore that his bankruptcy has
arisen from circumstances for which he cannot justly be held
responsible, and an expression of their desire that he should receive
an order of discharge. Roman law only admitted this in one case,
the case of a slave instituted heres necessarius, 2 ᾧ 155, in order to
save the credit of an insolvent testator. After once undergoing
bankruptcy, such a person was not liable to further molestation.
But the after-acquired property of other insolvents remained liable
to successive sales until plenary satisfaction of their debts. Accord-
ingly, bankruptcy is not enumerated, 3 ᾧ 168, as one of the modes
of extinguishing obligation.

To encourage the bankrupt, however, to make a bonorum cessio,
in order that as much as possible might be saved from the wreck of
his fortunes for the benefit of his creditore, bonorum cessio not only
discharged him, as we have seen, from personal execution, but dis·
charged from liability such portion of his after-acquired property
as was necessary for his subsistence. Qui bonis cesserint nisi
solidum creditor receperit non sunt liberati, Cod. 7, 71, 1. Is qui
bonis cesserit, si quid postea acquisierit, in quantum facere potest
convenitur, Dig. 42, 3, 4. ‘ Bonorum cessio does not discharge the
insolvent's estate until he makes full satisfaction‚ but exempts him
from Subsequent pursuit for more than he can afford to pay. ’

Both in Roman and in English law there is a transfer of the insol-
vent's juris universitas, but with this difference—inEnglish law the
bankrupt’s estate is vested in the creditor's trustes, in Roman law it
vested not in the magister but in the vendee, the emptor bonorum.

In the last period of Roman law, such as we find in the time of
J ustinian, venditio bonorum was superseded by distractio bonorum,
which involved no transfer of the juris universitas. A curator was
appointed by the praetor, and instead of selling the active and
passive universality of ‘the insolvent’s estate to a purchaser who
became liable to the insolvent's creditore, merely sold the active
residue of his estate in detail. J ustinian attributes this change to
the abolition of the formulary procedure and generalization of
cognitio extraordinaria3 Theophilus, to the abolition of the con·
ventus, assizes, sessione, or brief law terms of the provinces, and
the erection of permanent provincial tribunale. But it is not easy
to see in what respect the changes were correlated.

In ᾖ 80 Gaius apparently mentioned that one coee of bonorum
