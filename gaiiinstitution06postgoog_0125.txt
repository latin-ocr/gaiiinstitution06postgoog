end on the midnight separating a subsequent 1 Jan. from 2 Jan.
According to Savigny, then, the year by computatio naturalis will
be a mean between the years by the two modes of computatio
civilis 3 whereas, according to Vangerow, even the longer civil year
is shorter than the natural year. In other words, Savigny’s year
of 365 days is exclusive of the day containing the starting point,
while Vangerow’s is inclusive. It is true that the Romans used
both methods of computation (inclusive and exclusive) even in legal
documenta: and, for instance, Julius Caesar, in the edict establish-
ing the Julian calendar, intending every period of four years to be
increased by an intercalnry day, directed, ut quarto quoque anno
unum intercalarent diem, meaning every fourth year exclusive of
the last leap year: but the Pontifices interpreted the direction to
mean every fourth year including the last leap year, and in pre-
paring the annual calendars left only two ordinary years between
two successive leap years instead of three, an error which was con-
tinued for 36 years before it was discovered and rectified. But
the inclusive eomputation was used in naming the days of the
calendar (tertio ante oelendas, quarto ante calendae, &c.), and was
apparently the older and commonet mode of reckoning3 and Van-
gerow is probably right in supposing· it was always employed in the
civilis computatio of years.

Returning now to the interruption (usurpatio) of usucapio, we
shall find from the following passage of Gellius that the vesting of
manus by cohabitation was regarded as a loss of independence by
the wife, not as an acquisition of power by the husband, for the
latter eomputation was employed. Q. quoque Mucium jure con-
sultum dicere solitum legi, lege non isse usurpatum mulierem, quae,
quum kalendis J anuariis apud virum matrimonii causa esse coepisset,
ante diem quartum kalendas Januarias sequentes usurpatum isset:
non enim posse impleri trinoctium, quod abesse a viro usurpandi
eausa ex duodecim tabulis deberet, quoniam tertiae noctis posteriores
sex horae alterius anni essent qui inciperet ex kalendis, 3, 2. ‘ I
have read that, according to Quintus Mucius, the statutory require-
ments for the interruption of usucapion are not satisfied if a woman
married on the lst of J anuary and did not leave her husband's house
until the 29th of December, as she could not then be absent for
three whole nights before the end of the year, the interval required
by the Twelve Tables, because the last six hours of the third night
belong to the first day of the following year.' This implies that the
