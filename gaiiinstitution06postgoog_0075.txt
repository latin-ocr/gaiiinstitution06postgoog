nam nec civitatem adipisci nec) ‘ servum manere putat3 testamento
vero manumissum perinde haberi jubet, atque si domini voluntate
in libertate esset, ideoque latinus fit,' 1, 12. The subsequent lex
J unia Norbana apparently provided that, in the absence of causae

’ Ρ.ὈΒ81;ἰο, the minor triginta annis manumissus, whether testamento

or vindicta, should belong to the new class which it introduced,
namely, the Latini. Hence, by an intelligible anachronism, GaiuS,
ᾗ 29, ᾧ 31, speaks of Latini made ΒΥ the lex Aelia Sentia.

ᾧ 19. Alumnns denotes a slave child reared by the manumitter,
as appears from the following passage: Alumnos magis mulieribus
conveniens est manumittere, sed et in viris receptum est, satisque
est permitti eum manumitti in quo nutriendo propensiorem animum
fecerint, Dig. 40, 2, 14. ‘ Foster children are more naturally
manumitted ΒΥ women than ΒΥ men, though not exclusively3 and
it suffices to allow the manumission of a child who has won his
proprietor's affection in the course of his education.'

§2st The Equites Romani, who at Rome composed a moiety of
the judicial assessors, are opposed to Equites equo publico· Eques
Romanus was such merely ΒΥ his census: Eques equo publicO, in
the latter days of Rome, was a youth nominated ΒΥ the emperor to
the turmae equitum3 not, however, intended for actual service with
the legions, but merely marked out as an expectant of future
employment in higher public fiinctions, military or civil. The title
of Princeps juventutis, often conferred by the emperors on their
successors designate, denoted the leader of the Equites equo publico.
In the time of Augustus the list of judices (album judicum) con-
sisted of three panels (decuriae, Senatores), Equites Romani, and
Equites equo publico. Augustus added. a fourth, the Ducenarii‚
those whose census amounted to 200,000 sesterces, who judged
minor cases; and subsequently Caligula added a fifth.

Recuperators are jndges not taken from the panel (album jndi-
cum).

ᾧ 21. Ulpian adds, 1, 14, that a slave who otherwise would only
have become dediticius, or a freedman of the lowest class, if he

is instituted the heres necessarius of an insolvent, becomes civis
Romanus,

ᾧ 22. When manumission was a purely private act, it could not
confer the Roman franchise3 it could only make a dediticius or a
latinus.
