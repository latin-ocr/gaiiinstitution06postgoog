constituit) and Civil law as enacted ΒΥ the Roman legislature, he
uses language which, though probably traditional in the writings
of Roman jurists, is inappropriate and misleading3 for the enact-
ments of Nature differ from the enactmentS, express or tacit, of
political sovereigns in many important particulars.

Austin illustrates the character of Positive or Political· law ΒΥ
contrasting it in certain points with the law of Honour and the
law of Fasliion. ·

Unlike the purely Ethical law, or a law set by a man to himself,
which has nothing· in the nature of a sanction to compel him to
observe it, the law of Honour and the law of Fashion have certain
earthly sanctione annexed to them, whereby the party on whom
. the obligation is imposed is inclined to act agreeably to their
injunctions and prohibitione, The transgressor of these laws is

annexed to the law of Honour or of Fashion is applied « against
the party whose conduct deviates from the law ΒΥ another in·
determinate party of his own spontaneous movement3 not ΒΥ an
assignable functionary authorized ΒΥ the indeterminate lawgiver ⁶

minister of justice appointed by a determinate political sovereign
to execute the commands which he issueS. In these respects the
Natural or Gentile· law of Roman jurists differs from Moral law
and from the law of Opinion, and shows itself to be a genuine
portion of Positive or Political law,

'Phe organ by which the J us gentium of the Romans was pro-
mulgated, which made it ΒΥ quasi enactment a portion of Roman
Positive law, was principally the Edict of the Praetor peregrinus.
The relations of Roman citizens with aliens (peregrini), that is, with
the members of foreign states formerly subjugated ΒΥ Rome and
now living under the protection of Roman law, were subject to the
jurisdictio'n of a special minister of justice called Praetor peregrinus,
