40 DE PERsoms [1. ς 8.

provisions respecting Procedure have a double aspect: a purely
formal aspect, so far as they give regularity and method to the
enforcement of sanctioning rights ς and a material aspect, so far as
certain stages of procedure (e. g. litis contestatio and res judicata)
operate like Dispositions or any other Titles to modify the substan-
tive rights of the contending parties· Procedure, then, is treated
of in these Institutions partly indeed in its formal character, but
still more in its material character, i. e. so far as its incidents can
be regarded as belonging to the substantive code.

It is more difficult to determine the principle of the other division,
the relation of the law of Persons to the law of Things. They both
deal with the rights and duties of persons in the ordinary modern
acceptation of the word3 why then, we may inquire, are certain
rights and duties of persons separated from the rest and dealt with
under the distinguishing category of jura personarum? It is not

Ι ⁸ - enough to say with Aust-ip that the law of Things is the universal

or general portion of the law, the law of Persons a particular and
exceptional branch3 that it is treated separately on account of no
essentia] or characteristic differcnce‚ but merely because it is com-
modious to treat separately what is special and exceptional from
what is general and universal. This answer furnishes no positive
character of the law of Persons, but only the negative character
of anomaly, i. e. of unlikeness to the larger portion of the law;
but it would be difficult to show that the law of Persons is more
exceptional, anomalous, eccentric, than the Civil dispositions as
opposed to the Natural or Gentile dispositions of the law of Things.

We must look to the details of the law of PersonS, and observe
whether its dispositions have any common character as contrasted
with the dispositions of the law of Things. The law of PersonS,
in other wordS, the law of Status, classifies men as slaves and free,
as citizens (privileg-ed) and aliens (unprivileged), as paterfamilias
(superior) and filiusfamilias (dependent). The law of Things looks
at men as playing the parts of contractors or of neighbouring
proprietors3 in other wordS, the law of Persons considers men as
UNEQUALS, the law of Things considers them as EQUALS: the
one may be defined as the law of relations of inequality, the other as
the law of relations of equality.

It may induce us to believe that the law of unequal relations
and the law of equal relations is a fundamental division of the
general code, if we consider how essential are the ideas of equality
