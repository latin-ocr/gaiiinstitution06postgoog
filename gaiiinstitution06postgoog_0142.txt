sanction (auctoritas). Even in the latter period the guardian might

‘- act alone or concurrently according to his discretion: he probably

gave his sanction in proceedings governed by the Civil law [Nemo
alieno nomine lege agere potest, Dig. 50, 17, 123. ‘No appearance
in another person ’s name, i. e. no representation or agency‚ is ad-
missible' 1n statute- process’,] and simply administered ιιι proceedings
governed by the law of nations. In the time of Gaius, women
continued subject to guardianship after the age of puberty: the
functione of the guardian were then confined to auctoritas, which
in most cases was a mere formality 3 the power of administration
vested in the woman, ξ 190.

ξ 147. Postumus (afterborn) has no etymological connection with
inhumation, and no reference to the death of the testator, but simply
denotes a person born after the execution of a will, whether aster
the death or in the lifetime of the testator. The law, however,
originally made a distinction between the two cases. The institu-
tion or disinherison of a postumus born after the death of a testator

was valid at Civil law, and availed to save the will from rupture by -

afterbirth (agnatio) of an immediate successor (suus heres): the
same institution or disinherison would have been invalid and un-
availing if the postumus had been born in the lifetime of the
testator, before the enactment of the lex J unia Velleia in the reign
of Augustus, 2 ᾧ 130, commentary. A grandson was postumus
alienus if born in the lifetime of his father; he was postumus suus,
i. e. immediate lineal successor to his grandfather, if born after the
death of his father, 2 ξ 241, and only in this event could he receive
a guardian by the will of his grandfather. Aquillius Gallus in-
vented a form for the conditional institution or disinherison of a
grandson, and, doubtless, also for the nomination of his guardian,
by a will executed in the lifetime of his father: conditioned, that
is, to take effect in the event of the decease of the father before the
death of the grandfather. It appears, then, that the statement of
Gaius, ξ 147, is inaccurate, unless we complete it by words taken
from the parallel passage in the Institutes‚ and read: Si modo in
ea causa sint ut, si vivis nobis nascantur, [sui et] in potestate nostra
fiant.

ᾧ 148. In filii manu must be regarded as an inaccurate expres-
sion: for filiusfamilias was incapable of all civil rights, including
manus, and could only serve as a conduit-pipe by which the right of
manus vested in his father.
