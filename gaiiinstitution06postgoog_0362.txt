regarded as strangers) the patron and his descendants to the fifth
degree are entitled to a clear third of the inheritance. This third
to which the patron is entitled against the external devisee of an
opulent freedman, J ustinian calls his Falcidia, and says that the
Falcidia. of the devisees, instead of being one fourth of the estate as
in other cases, will in this case be only a fourth of two thirds, that
is, a sixth of the estate, cod. 6, 4. In fact, the praetorian edict
giving the patron in the absence of sui heredes naturales of the
freedman a right to a moiety of his estate, and the lex Papia giving
him a right to a half or a third, even concurrently with sui heredes
naturales, had really pro tanto promoted the patron from the order
of agnates, assigned to him by the Twelve Tables, to that of sui
heredes3 at least, they gave him indefeasible rights similar to those
of suus heres, both against intestato successione and against testa-
mentum inofficiosum. J ustinian cut down the rights of the patron
and reduced him, except in this instance, to his old rank of agnate:
still, by calling his portion his Falcidia, he recognizes that he has
to this extent treated him as a suus heres.

A remarkable feature which pervades these new rules of succes-
sion to intestate freedmen is their disregard of agnation or civil
relationship, wherein they are an anticipation of Novella, 1 18,
which, ΛΑ). 543, eliminated agnation from title by descent in the
succession of ingenui. It had, taken eight or nine hundred years
to rid Roman jurisprudence of a barbarian caprice which had filled
it with intricacy and, as irrational laws cannot be supposed to be
generally comprehended, must have often caused cruel disappoint-
ments as to the devolution of property among blood relations.
