χρέος εἷς καινὸν δάνειον μετασχηματίζομενον ῥήμασι καὶ γράμμασι τυπι-
κοῖς. . . . ἦν δὲ ταῦτα τὰ ῥήματα, ἅτινα καὶ ἐλέγετο καὶ ἑγράφετο’
τοὺς ἑκατὸν χρυσοῦς, οὓς ἐμοὶ ἐξ αἰτίας μισθώσεως χρεωστεΐς, σὺ ἐκ
συνθήκης καὶ ὁμολογίας δώσεις τῶν οἰκείων γραμμάτων 3 εἶτα ἑνεγράφετο,
ὦς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἑνόχου ἤδη γενομένου ἐκ τῆς μισθώσεως, ταῦτα τὰ ῥήματα·
Ἐκ τῆς συνθήκης ὀφείλω τῶν οἰκείων γραμμάτων. Καὶ ἡ μὲν προτέρα
ἑνοχῆ ἀπεσβέννυτο, καινοτέρα δὲ ἐτίκτετο, Theophilus, 3, 21. ‘ A literal
obligation was an old debt transformed into a new loan by certain
solemn words and writings. 'Phe words which were spoken and
written in the register were as follows: “ The hundred aurei which
you owe me on account of rent will you pay me on the convention
and acknowledgment of your own journal '?” Then followed, as if
written by the person indebted for rent, these words: “ I owe you
that sum by the admission of my own journal.” Whereby the
pre-existing obligation was extinguished and a new one created?
[From the mention of ‘ solemn words’ Theophilus is supposed to
have confounded Expensilatio, which was independent of spoken
words, with Stipulatio accompanied by a written record or CAUTIQ]

The account of Theophilus clearly only applies to one form of
expensilation‚ the transcriptio a re in personam. The use of this
kind of transcriptio is obvious: it was a mode of converting Form-
less contracts into Formal contracts—equitable obligations into
civil obligations: of metamorphosing claims recoverable by actions
ex bona fide, e. g. conducti locati, empti venditi, which in many
points favoured the defendant, into debts recoverable by the short
and sharp remedy of the civil action of CondictiO, which, when
brought for certa pecunia credita, was the more formidable to a

 

dishonest litigant, as it was accompanied by sponsio poenalis, >m

whereby the vanquished party forfeited a third of the sum in liti· ’
gation, in addition, if he was the defendant, to the original claim,
4 § 171.

A narrative of Cicero shows the employment and possible mis-
employment of this transcriptiO. He relates how a purchaser was
defrauded by a vendor, and in consequence of the form of contract
had no redress. Stomachari Canius· Sed quid faceret Ρ Nondum
enim Aquilius collega et familiaris meus protulerat de dolo malo
formulas, De Off. 3, 14. ‘ 'Phe purchaser was indignant, but he
was helpless, for my colleague Aquilius had not then invented the
action of Fraud.' It may occur to ue, on hearing tho story, that as
the actio Empti was an action ex bona fide, that is, one in which
