others make as many orders as there
are forms of guardian.

A magisterially appointed guardian is called by modern com-
mentatore tutor dativus, a name used by Gaius in another sense,
ξ 1543 by the Romans he was called tutor Atilianus or J uliotiti-
auus (see Theophilus), in memory of the statutes from whence the
magistrates derived their power of nominating to the office of
guardian. This power was not a portion of their inherent or
immemorial attributione (imperium, jurisdictio): Tutoris datio
neque imperii est neque jurisdictionis, sed ei soli competit cui
nominatim hoc dedit vel lex vel senatusconsultum vel princePS.
Dig. 26, 1, 6, 2. It was conferred on the praetor by the lex Atilia 3
on the praeses provinciae by the lex J ulia et Titia. The lex Atilia
is of uncertain date, but from Livy (post patroni mortem, quia

nullius in manu esset, tutore a tribunis et praetore petito, 39, 9) it ·

appears to have been older than 197 B.c. As there were ten tri-
bunes, and the lex Atilia required the concurrence of the majority,
the tutor Atilianus was nominated by the praetor and six tribunes.
The lex J ulia et Titia empowering the praeses provinciae to uomi-
nate a guardian is placed in the year 31 Β.ο.

In the time of J ustinian the Atilian and J uliotitian guardian,
not being compellable to act or to give security for the due dis-
charge of their office, had fallen into desuetude, aud in their stead
guardians were appointed by the consul or praetor or praeses pro-
vinciae, after a special investigation (ex inquisitione). J ustinian
empowered the municipal magistrate called defensor civitatis, with
the assistance of the bishop, to appoint guardiaus, taking securities
for the due discharge of their office, whenever the fortune of the
ward was under 500 golden solidi3 a golden solidus being between
a sovereign and a napoleon, i. e. 22} francs, in value. Guardians
appointed after inquest (ex inquisitione) were not required to give
security for due administration, Inst. 1, 20, 3.
