ᾧ 154. The forced sale of a person's whole estate might be
the result of either a criminal or a civil proceeding, either con-
demnation for crime or insolvency, and in the latter case for the
benefit either of the State or of private creditors. Damnatione bona
publicantur cum aut vita adimitur aut civitas aut servilis conditio
irrogatur, Dig. 48, 20, 1. ‘ Condemnation forfeits all a criminal's
goods to the treasury, if it deprives of life, or involves loss of civitas
(capitis minutio media), or loss of liberty (capitis minutio maxima).'

Confiscation (publicatio) under its ancient name of sectio bono-
rum, has already, 3 ᾧ 80, been mentioned. The quaestore of the
treasury were sent into possession3 the sale, which was publicly
advertised (proscriptio), took place under the spear (sub hasta), the
symbol of absolute dominion, and vested in the purchaser (sector)
quiritarian ownership.

ξ 155. Mandatum consistit sive
nostra gratia mandemus sive aliena,
id est sive ut mea negotia geras,
sive ut alterius mandem tibi, erit
inter nos obligatio, et invicem alter
alteri tenebimur, ideoque iudicium
erit in id quod paret te mihi bona
fide praestare oportere.

ξ 156. Nam si tua gratia tibi
mandem, supervacuum est manda-
tum 5 quod enim tu tua gratia fac·
turus sis, id ex tua sententia, non

ex meo mandatu facere videberis :a

itaque si otiosam pecuniam (lomi te
habere mihi dixeris, et ego te hor-
tatus fuerim, ut eam fenerares,
quamvis eam ei mutuam dederis
a quo servare non potueriS, non
tamen habebis mecum mandati
actionem. item et si hortatus sim,
uc rem aliquam emeres, quamvis
non expedierit tibi eam emisse, non
tamen ‘mandati tibi tenebor. et
adeo baec ita sunt, ut quaeratur an
mandati teneatur qui mandavit tibi,
ut Titio pecuniam fenerares [desunt

disses, quam si tibi mandatum esset.

ξ 155. Agency may contemplate
the benefit either of the principal or
of a stranger 3 that is to say, your
undertaking at my request to traus-
act my business or the business of
a third person will create an obli·
gation between us, and make us
mutually liable and compellable to
satisfy the demands of good saith.

ξ 156. But if I recommend you
to perform anything for your own
exclusive advantage, there is no re-
lation of agency, for you will act on
your own judgment and not 119 my
commissiona= If you tell me that
you have money lying in your cash-
box, and, 011 my advice to lend it at
interest, you lend it to a person from
whom you cannot recover it, you will
have no action of mandate against
me: or if I recommend you to buy,
and you lose by buying‚ I am not
liable to be sued in action of man-
date. So settled is this, that it has
been questioned, whether mandate
can be brought on a specifio recom-
mendation to lend to Titius3 but
the prevalent opinion is that of
SabinuS, that so specific a recom-
