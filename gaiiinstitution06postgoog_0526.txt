504 DE ACTIONIBUS. [w. ἕξ 18-20.

(c) The ground to support any given condictio or actio stricti juris
is precisely defined: whereas an actio ex bona fide, e. g. an actio
empti or venditi, cannot only be brought on the principal contract
—emptio venditio—for which it is appropriate but also on any
accessory conventions (pacta adjecta) and on any attendant circum·
stauces of fraud (dolus) or intimidation (metus). In the later law,
however, contemporaneous conventions were treated as integral por-
tions of the contracte of jus strictum: Pacta incontinenti facta
stipulationi inesse creduntur, Dig. 12, 1, 40. Accordingly interest
as well as principal could be recovered in an aetion (incerti con·
dictio) on a stipulatio to pay a certain sum with an annexed
convention to pay interest at a certain rate. In the same way
accessory conventions coaleseed into a single coutract when
annexed to a loan: Omnia quae inseri stipulationibus munt,
eadem possunt etiam numerationi pecuniae et ideo et conditiones,
Dig. 12, 1, 7. In the case of a loan of money, however, interest
could not be recovered on a oontemporaneous convention because
the only action a loan of money could support was condictio certi:
on a loan of any other quantitas but money, interest could be re-
covered because the aetion such a contract would support was
condictio incerti, Cod. 4, 32, 23. Savigny, ᾗ 268.

(d) The Defeuce in an actio stricti juris could only alleg-e matters
which ipso jure extinguished or annihilated a claim (e. g. solutio,
acceptilatio, novatio), or, if they founded a counter-claim of the
defendant, had been disclosed to the praetor in the preliminary
pleadings (in jure) in the form of an exceptio: whereas the arbiter
who tried an actio ex bona fide could consider any counter-obliga-
tions of the plaintiff even when they were averred for the first
time in the course of the trial: Exceptio doli bonae fidei judiciis
inest, Dig. 23, 3, 21.

(e) In respect of the accessione (omnis causa) in which a defendant
was condemned, namely fruetus and usurae, there was a difference
between actiones stricti juris and ex bona fide: in the former the de·
fendant was only liable to pay these from the date of Litis contestatio;
whereas in the latter he was liable from the date of Mora, 2 ξ 280.

(f) As all condemnations under the formulary system were in
pecuniary damages it was necessary in the event ofa condemnation
that the thing in dispute should be valued in money. In actions
stricti juris the moment fixed for the valuation (aestimatio) was
Litis contestatio: in bonae fidei actions the date of valuation was
