664 ADDENDUM.

In this single point, then, Mancipation and J udicial Surrender
were more completely isolated from their causa than 'l'raditionz
but with this exception Formal and Formless alienatione were
equally Ansmcr. Both operated transfer of dominion in spite of
any flaw in the causa. If such a flaw existed in either a Forma!
or a Formless alienation, it only gave the alienor a persona] action
(condictio) against the alienee for reconveyance. He could not re·
cover the property if it had passed out of the hands of the first
alienee into those of a second.

If we inquire why Formless alienation was allowed to have
validity irrespectively of the causal factor, we shall find the reason
to be, that Tradition or parting with possession, though a Formlesa
proceeding, is an act of so serious a character as effectually to
preclude all idea of indecision—to prove that the parties had
reached the stage of definitive resolution. Accordingly the inten-
tion of transferring ownership when manifested by Tradition seems
to deserve all the efficacy that could be imparted by the observance
of the most solemn Forms.

As in the later jurisprudence Stipulatio was robbed of part of
its efficacy by the Exceptio pecuniae non numeratae, so in the later
period of Roman law Alienations whether Formal or Formless were
deprived of part of the trenchancy of their operation by the actio
quod metus causa and Restitutio minorum, impersonal remedies
(in rem) which reached the property to whatever hands it might
have arrived by the effect of subsequent alienatione.

If, then, Formal alienations were not simplifications of title in
virtue of any greater Ansmcrnxss than was possessed by Form-
less alienation, for what other advantage were they introduced into
commerce ⁹? by what other attribute were they a facilitation of Proof?
They facilitated proof (1) of the specific intention of a disposer
against an allegation of a different intention, and (2) of the exis-
tence of intention against the denial of all intention.

(1) Tradition might be made with the design of merely trans-
ferring Detention. Such was its effect in Depositum, commodatum,
Mandatum, LocatiO. Or, secondly, it might be made with the
purpose of transferring something more than Detention, namely
Possession. Such was its effect in Pignus and Precarium. Or,
thirdly, it might be made with the intent of transferring Property,
as in Donati0‚ Mutuum, Solutio. Which of these intentions
prompted a given Traditio might be extremely difficult to prove.
