stanee, or mother, or governor, or
foster-brother of the manumittet,
is the slave to be manumitted. In
addition to these, the motives re-
eently specified respecting the slave
under thirty years of age, may be
alleged when the manumitting
owner is under twenty; and, re·
oiprocally, the motives valid when
the manumitting owner is under
twenty, are admissible when the
manumitted slave' is under thirty.

ξ 40. As, then, the lex Aelia Sen-
tia prescribes a certain mode of
manumission for owners under the

tiam constitutus sit, evenit, ut qui Ὺ( age of twenty, it follows that,

xlm annos aetatis expleverit, lieet
testamentum faeere possit, et in eo

relinquere possit, tamen, si adhue
minor sit annorum xx, libertatem

i though after completing his four-

teenth year, a person is competent
to make a will, and therein to in-
stitute an heir and leave bequests;
yet, until he has attained the age
of twenty, he cannot therein en·
franchise a slave.

§41.And even to confer the
Latin status, if he is under the age
of twenty, the owner must satisfy
the counoil of the adequacy of his
motive before he manumits the
slave in the presenoe of witnesses.

ᾗ 41. J ustinian permitted minors to enfranehise by will as soon

as they could make a valid will, i. e. at the age of 14, Novella,
119, 2. He mentions that the lowest olass of freedmen (deditieia
libertas) had long been obsolete‚ and formally abolished the second
class (latina libertas), converting most of the modes of making·
Latinus into modes of making Civis Romanus, and declaring the
rest inoperative, eod. 7, 6.
