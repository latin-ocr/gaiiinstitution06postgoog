de tutela legitima nisi omnium tutorum auctoritate deminui. Co-
emptione? omnibus ergo auctoribus, Cic. Pro Flacco, 34. ‘ Had
the wife become subject to marital power by cohabitation or by
coemption? Certainly not by either, for the rights of agnatio
guardians cannot be defeated without the concurrence of all the
guardians.'

Coemption was sometimes employed for other purposes than
matrimony, and was then called fiduciary coemption. Sometimes
the intention was to extinguish the obligation of onerous sacred
rites attached to the estate of an heiress: J ure consultorum ingenio
senes ad coemptiones faciendas interimendorum sacrorum eausa
reperti sunt, Cic. Pro Murena, 12. ‘ J uristic ingenuity invented
coemptions with aged men for extinguishing sacred rites.’ Savigny
gives the following conjectural explanation of the process· The
obligation to the sacra belonged to the Quiritary ownership of the
universitas of the woman's estate. This, by the effect of coempffion,
vested in the coemptionator, an old man approaching dissolution
(senex coemptionalis)‚ with whom a fictitious marriage was con-
tracted, and who took the estate as universal successor. He
forthwith dismissed the woman from his manus by remancipation
and manumission: and then, according to covenaut, restored to her
the estate in portions3 that is, released from the ritual obligations,
which only attached to the universitas, On his death, as Quiritary
owner of the empty universitas the obligation to the rites was extin-
guished: for the succession (hereditas) to the coemptionator did not
pass to the woman, as she by remancipation had eeased to be
[such was the hypothesis of Savigny before the discovery of Gaius:
instructed by Gaius we must rather say, as mere fiduciary coemp-
tion had not the effect of making her] his filiafamilias and sua
heres. In PlautuS, Bacchides, 4, 8, 52, and Cicero ad diversos:
Sum enim χρήσει μὲν tuus, κτήσει δὲ Attici nostri. Ergo fructus est
tuus, mancipium illius3 quod quidem si inter senes coemptionales
proscripserit, egerit non multum, 7, 29: the phrase senex coemp-
tionalis denotes a slave. From which it may be inferred that a
slave, useless for any other purpose, and therefore very cheap, was
sometimes bought and manumitted to serve as coemptionator. In
such a case the whole transaction would be very inexpensive, if
not very decorous. This mode of getting rid of sacred rites is com-
pared by Ihering, §58, with the institution of a slave as suc-
cessor to bear the infamy of bankruptcy instead of a bankrupt
