DE LEGITIMA AGNATORUM TUTELA.

ξ 155. Quibus testamento quidem
tutor datus non sit, iis ex lege ΧΠ
agnati sunt tutores, qui vocantur

legitimi.

§156. Sunt autem agnati per
virilis sexus personas cognatione
iuncti, quasi a patre cognati : ve-
luti stater eodem patre natue, fra·
tris filius neposve ex eo, item pa-
truus et patrui filius ec nepos ex
eo. At hi qui per feminini sexus
personas aequatione iunywntur non
sunt aquati, sed alias naturali iure
cognati. itaque inter avunculum et
sororis filium non agnatio est, sed
cognatio. item amitae, materterae
filius non est mihi agnatus, set cog-
natus, et invicem scilicet ego illi
eodem iure coniunqor: quia qui
nascuntur patris, non matris fami·
liam sequuntur.

ξ 157. Sed olim quidem, quan·
tum ad legem x11 tabularum attinet,
etiam feminae agnatos habebant tu·
tores3 set postea lex Claudia lata
est quae, quod ad feminas attinet,
tutelas illas sustulit. itaque mas-
culus quidem inpubes fratrem pube-
rem aut patruum habet tutorem 3
feminae vero talem habere tutorem

. non inadequmtur.

ξ 158. Set agnationis quidem ius
capitis diminutione perimitur, cog-
nationis vero ius non commutatur.
quia civilis ratio civilia quidem lura
corrumpere potest, naturalia vero
non potest.

ᾗ 155. In default of a testament-
ary guardian the statute of the
Twelve Tables assigns the guardian-
ship to the nearest agnates‚ who
are hence called statutory guar·
dians.

ξ 156. Agnates (3 ξ 10) are cog-
nates through males, that is, through
their male ascendents: as a brother
by the same father, such brother's
son or son’s son ; a father's brother,
his son or son's son. Cognates
through female ascendente are
merely natural kinsmen. Thus,
between a man and his sister's son
there is not agnation, but cogna-
tion : so my father's sister's son or
my mother’s sister's son is not my
agnate, but my cognate, and vice-
versa3 for children are members
of their father’s family, but not
of their mother's.

ξ 157. In former times, the statute
of the Twelve Tables made females
as well as males wards of their
agnates : subsequently a law of the
Emperor Claudius abolished this
wardship in the case of females:
accordingly, a male below the age
of puberty has his brother above
the age of puberty or his paternal
uncle for guardian, but females are
not in the wardship of their agnates.

ξ 158. Loss of status extinguishes
rights by agnation‚ while it leaves
unaffected rights by cognatim, be-
cause civil changes can affect rights
annexed to a civil title, but not
rights annexed to a natural title.

The maxim of the Civil law is stated by J ustinian: Plerumque
ubi successionis est emolumentum, ibi et tutelae onus esse deb'et,

Inst. 1, 1⁹7.

‘ As a general mle, those that have the emolument of
succession should bear the burden of guardianship.’

Feudal law,

and its daughter, the Common law, in respect of guardianship in
socage, was guided by the opposite policy. Guardianship in socage
