manumissus erit, cadit in eius pote-
statem ; si vero is, dum in mancipio
sit, decesserit, sui iuris fit.

§1356. Et de ....licet
[1 lim] ut supra diximus, quod in
filio faciunt tres mancipationes, hoc
facit una mancipatio in nepote.

long as the father is in mancipation
the status of the child is in suspen-
sion, and if the father is manumitted
the child falls under his power; if
the father dies in mancipation the
child becomes independent.

ξ 135 b. . . . asbefore mentioned,
the result of three mancipatione of
the son is obtained ΒΥ a single
mancipation of the grandson.

ξ 136. A wife subjected to the
hand of a husband ΒΥ confarreation
is not thereby freed from the power
of her father-5 and this is declat-ed
by the senatusconsult of the consuls
Maximus and Tubero respecting
the priestess of Jove, which limite
the marital hand to the sphere of
sacred rights, and declares the status
of the wife unaffected in other re·
specte by subjection to the hand of
the husband. Subjection to hand
ΒΥ coemption liberates from the
power of the parent, and it is im-
material whether it is a coemption
subjecting the woman to the hand
of a husband or to the hand of a
stranger, although the status of
quasi daughter only belongs to a
woman in the hand of a husband.

ᾖ 132. The epitomator of Gaius in the code of Alaric 2 mentions
as present at an emancipation‚ besides the five witnesses and libripens,
a seventh person whom he calls antestatus, who is also mentioned in κ
the bronze tablet quoted in the remarks on pignus and fiducia, Book 3.

The vindicta or wand used in manumission, as already stated, was
the rod or verge symbolizing a lance carried by the parties in a real
aetion. The status of freedom (libertas) whether as opposed to
slavery or to bondage (mancipii causa) was a real right (jus in rem),
and therefore a subject to be contested in a vindicatio. Manumis·
sion ΒΥ vindicta was a collusive vindicatio, in other words, an in

, , - jure cessio,

The epitomator of Gaius calls the person to whom the son was
mancipated pater fiduciarius, which implies that the mancipation

was accompanied by a fiducia or declaration of trust. The trust
would be that the pater fiduciarius should make default or confess

in the subsequent vindicatiO.
