500 ACTIONIBUS. [ιν. §5 10-17.

or place of combat‚ the champion of the tenant takes his adversary
by the hand [manuum consertio] and makes oath that the tenements
in dispute are not the right of the demandant, and the champion
of the demandant then taking the other by the hand swears in the
same manner that they are: so that each champion is or ought
to be thoronglily persuaded of the truth of the cause he fights for.
Next, an oath against sorcery and enchantment is to be taken by
both the 0113111Ρί033. . . . The battle is then begun,’ Blackstone,
3, 22. If we rely on this parallel the manuum consertio was the
oath or pledge (δεξίωμα) 11131 63011 party believed 13 1116 justice of his
cause. The usjnrandum of the later law, which permitted either
party to resi the decision of a dispnte to the oath of his opponent,
would be a derivative from the sacramentum or 1116 31111 older pro-
cess from which the sacramentnm descended3 consisting of 036 half
of 1116 process, the appeal to religione sanctiens (mannum consertio),
and omitting the other half, the subseqnent dnel. It must be 003-
fessed, however, that 3036 of our authorities allude to the oath (jus-
jurandum) having formed a part of the procedure by sacramentnm.
Is it possible, when we consider the common Aryan descent of

the Romans and onr Teutonic 330631013,10 suppose any connection
between these forms of Roman and Teutonic litigation? Or was
mannum consertio 13616 J 3 symbolis battle, an idle reminiscence of
a process belonging to a period anterior to the existence of public
tribunale, the period of Self-help, when the remedy of the litigant
was to redress his wrongs by the prowess of his own right hand?
Or. was manuum consertio, like Deductio and Vis ex conventu,
4 ᾧ 170, 3 fictitious 1163111133, necessary as 3, basis for penal pro-
ceedings by Sacramentum? Or was it merely a means of 3161ῥῖ-
fying the subject of litigation Ρ

ᾧ 16. The specification of the title or ground of claim (expressio
causae) in a real action (secundum suam causam sicut dixi) was
probably limited 10 30110113 where the subject claimed was a person,
and was then designed 10 (113113831311 whether the person was ‚
claimed as a 303, wife, bondsman (mancipium), or slave. See p. 114.
Perhaps, however, it was universally required in Statute-process
though not in the formulary system, p. 189.
