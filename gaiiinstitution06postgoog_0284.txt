262 DE RERUM UNIVERSITATIBUS. [11. §185-190.

titisse enim a libertatis datione videtur dominus qui eum alienavit,
Inst‚ 2, 14, 1. ‘ A revocation of the bequest of liberty is inferred
from the' fact of his alienation.' If we ask why the implied inten-
tion that suffices to revoke the enfranehiscment does not suffice to
revoke the institution, the answer is, that a bequest ean be revoked
by implied intention, whereas an institution requires a more solemn
revocation, by cancellation of the will, or execution of a later will,
or some other meane, 2 ξ 151.

ξ 189. What was the motive of instituting as successor the slave,
of another person? Such a disposition could not be dictated by
kindness to the slave, for he would gain nothing by his institution3
but was a device adopted for two purposes‚ (r) for facilitating the
conversion of a succession into money, and (2) for securing a
devise against lapse.

(1) By such a disposition the testator gave the devisee who was
proprietor of the slave the option of either becoming actual suc-
cessor, or of doing, what he could not otherwise readily do [2 ᾧ 36],
1. e. of receiving the net value, or a large portion of the net valae,
of the successim, without incurring the expense of the annexed
sacred rights (sacra) and the burden of administration‚ by practi-
cally selling the suecession for the highest price he could get to
any one who was willing to incur these expenses and troubles
as a matter of speculation. To effect this, he had only to sell
the slave at a price enhanced by his character of institutus. The
slave thereupon, making aditio of the inheritance in obedience to
an order of the purchaser, vested the inheritance in the purchaser.
If the former proprietor was reluctant to part with his slave, he had
only to bargain for his reconveyance by a fiducia or covenant
annexed to the sale or mancipatio. Reddendus (i. e. mancipandus)
est servus ea conditione ut, cum jussu ejus adierit, rursum retra-
datur‚ D. 28, 3, 58. ΒΥ this branch of speculation the instituted
slave might pass through many hands before the succession vested,
D. 37, 11, 2, 9.

(2) A second object gained by the institution of another person’s
slave was the transmission of an inheritance to the heirs of an
intended devisee. If the devisee died in the lifetime of the testator,
the devise lapsed, and the lapse could not be prevented by the
substitution (secondary institution) of the heir of the devisee, for
such heir would be a persona incerta, ᾧ 242. Τ116 difficulty was
