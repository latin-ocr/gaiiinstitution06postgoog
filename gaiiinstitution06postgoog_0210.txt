executive power. Thus: we have seen that only non-mancipable
things were capable at civil law of transfer by tradition3 suppose,
now, that a mancipable thing were conveyed to a vendee· by tradi-
tion; the process would not make him proprietor3 he would be
merely a bona fide possessor, until by the lapse of a year or of
two years he acquired quiritary property by usucapion. The
praetor, however, assisted the less cumbrous mode of alienation by
treating the vendee as proprietor 3 by giving him, if in possession,
the exceptio rei venditae et traditae against the vendor who sought
to recover as quiritary proprietor‚ and enabling the vendee, if dis·
possessed, to recover against the world by a vindication based on a
fiction of usucapion (actio in rem Publiciana, 4 ξ 36). Bonitary
proprietorship‚ or proprietorship acquired by titles unknown to the
civil law, when onoe invented, was employed by the praetor in other
legislative innovationS, particularly, as we shall see hereafter, in
creating universal successions (bonorum possessio) in bankruptcy,
and universal successore unknown to the civil law in testamentary
and intestate devolution. These bonitary proprietors could assert
their rights by an action, real 01· personal‚ based on a fiction of
inheritance (formula Serviana, 4 ᾗ 35), or an action, real οι· per-
sonal, not based on fiction, but in which they appeared as procura-
tors of the original proprietor (formula Rutiliana, 4 ξ 35).

The barbarous term Bonitary (formed from the classical, in bonis
esse, in bonis habere), has the authority of TheophiluS, who speaks
of δεσπότης βονιτάριος, 1, 5, 43 he also calls bonitary dominion
natural dominion (φυσικὴ δεσποτεία), as opposed to statutory, civil,
or quiritary dominion (ἔννομος δεσποτεία).

The only substantial inferiority in later times of the bonit-ary to
the quiritary proprietor was that the former was incapable of giving
by manumission more than latina libertas, 1 ᾧ 213, so that after
Latinitas was abolished J ustinian could truly say that the differ-
ence between the two kinds of ownership was merely nominal,
cod. 7, 25.

ᾇ 43. Quiritary dominion, as separated from bonitary dominion,
was called nudum jus quiritium. Aster J ustinian had abolished the
nudum jus quiritium, cod. 7, 25, and the distinction of things
mancipable and things not mancipable, Cod. 7, 31, and, con-
sequently‚ the distinction between bonitary and quiritary dominion,
we might have expected that the actio Publiciana, which, as we
have just seen, originated in the distinction between things man-
