inventory‚ and in no case is he answerable to the testator's creditore
beyond the assets that come to his hands, unless for a sufficient
consideration he make his own estate chargeable by a written
engagement, as provided by the Statute of Frauds.

ᾧ 165. When a right is extinguished by inactivity prolonged foi·
a certain period, the period has two modes of measurement: either
every day is counted, and then the period is called tempus con-
tinuum; or only available days, days on which activity is possible,
are counted3 and then the period is called tempus utile. When a
general rule prescribes a term, not greater than a year, within
which certain steps must be taken before a court or judicial
authority, on pain of forfeiting certain rights, such a term must
be measured as tempus utile. Such are the rules requiring certain
suits to be instituted within a year from their nativity, that is,
limiting a year for their period of prescription3 and the rule
requiring the demand of the possession of a heritage (agnitio
bonorum possessionis), whether testate or intestate‚ to be made, if
the claimant is an ascendant or descendant, within a year3 if he
is a sti-anger, within a hundred days. When the step required is
rendered impossible, not by a permanent obstacle, such as infancy,
lunacy, prodigality‚ or juristic personality, but by some transitory
circumstance, the days on which the action is hindered are excluded
from the computation of the term.

Such hindranee (1) may relate to the person entitled, and then
will be his captivity‚ or his absence on public service, or his deten-
tion by westher or illness, coupled with inability to appoint a
procurator:

(2) Or, in the case of the limitation of actions, it may relate to
the person of the defendant: if, for instance, he is unknown, or
concealed, or absent and undefended:

(3) Or it may consist in the absence of the praetor from the
court. Such absence might be accidental, or it might arise from
the regular intermission of the dies juridici, or days on which the
praetor performed his judicial functions, 2 ᾧ 279. As in the time
of Marcus Aurelius, such days only amounted to 230 in a year
(Suetonius, Octavianus, 32), this cause alone would make annus
utilis equivalent to about 1} ordinary years. The intermission of
dies juridici was doubtless the principal cause of a claimaut's
inability to perform an act in court on certain days: but in con-
temporary Roman law, now that judicial acts consist in delivery
