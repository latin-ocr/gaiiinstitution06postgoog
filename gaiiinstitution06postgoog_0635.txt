Res judicata, p. 5⁷9. In the Digest praescriptio has become a mere
synonym of exceptio,

rei dies fuit, we may quote an anecdote which Cicero puts into the
mouth of Crassus in illustration of the gross ignorance occasionally
displayed by the Roman advocate: Quid ¹? his paucis diebus nonne,
nobis in tribunali Q. Pompeii praetoris urbani familiaris nostri seden-
tibus, homo ex numero disertorum postulabat ut illi unde peteretur

few days ago when I was sitting as assessor of the.praetor urbanus,
the defendant’s advocate pressed the praetor to insert in the formula
the old and common exception: m Excmslvn RESPEc'r or THE PAY-

When mancipation was the usual mode of transferring property in
immovables and was complete without delivery of possession, Ulpian,
19, 6, and when, further, the rules of litis consumptio prevailed,
a plaintiff would occasionally need the praescriptio: Ea res agatur
de fundo mancipando. At a later period transfer of possession

became the only means of transferring property, and the rules of
res in judicium deducta (lis contestata), as we have men, underwent

a reform.

Praescriptio, in the legislation of J ustinian, is sometimes equiva-
lent to Usucapio. This arose in the following manner. A pro-
prietor’s right to recover by vindicatio might at an early period
be barred by an averment of adverse possession, during ten years, if
the parties were domiciled in the same province, during twenty
years, if they were domiciled in different provinces (longi temporis
possessio). This exceptio of the defendant appeared in the formula
in the shape and under the name of a praescriptio. When, by later
legislation, longi temporis possessio accompanied with bona fides
became a title whereby property was acquired (usucapio), p. 581, it
still retained its original name of praescriptio 3 though, perhaps, to
