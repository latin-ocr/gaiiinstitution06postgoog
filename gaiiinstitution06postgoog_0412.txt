390 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [111. βξ 97-109.

This transformation of a verbal or literal into a real contract was,
however, confined to contracte contemplating a loan of money.
I gnorare autem non debes non numeratae pecuniae exceptionem
ibi locum habere ubi quasi credita pecunia petitur, cod. 4, 30, 5.
⁸ The exception of money not received is confined to actions brought
to recover money lent.’ Moreover, by a constitution of Marcus
Aureliae, if the stipulation was accompanied by a written document,
the exception could only be pleaded within five years from the date
of the contract, which delay was reduced to two years by J ustinian‚
Just. 3, 21, aster which interval the cautio was accepted as incon-
trovertible proof that the money had been advanced. After this
interval, accordingly, Stipulation, armed with a written document,
resumed, or rather for the first time assumed, its proper character
of a Formal contract. ,

If no written document accompanied the Stipulation, no length
of time barred the defendant from pleading the exceptio Non
numeratae pecuniae.

If the plaintiff, instead of suing on the Stipulatio, sued on an
alleged loan (Mutuum), the defence of the defendant, though sub-
stantially the same, viz. that- he had never received the money,
being a mere contradiction of the intentio, would not appear in the
formula in the shape of an exceptio. (For the circumstances under
which a defence took the form of Exceptio, see 4 ᾧ 115).

But the usual practice was to associate a Loan with a Stipulatio,
and then the lender brought his action not on the Loan but on
the Stipulatio. Hence the question of the existence or non-exist-
ence of a Loan was usually litigated not in the form of an action
brought on a Loan, but in the form of an Exceptio non numeratae
pecuniae in an action brought on a Stipulation.
