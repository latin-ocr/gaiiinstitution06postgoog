libertatibus erogare, nec quicquam
hemdi relinquere praeterquam' inane
nomen heredis; idque lex 111 tabu-

larum permittere videbatur, qua ca-

vetur, ut quod quisque de re sua
testatus esset, id ratum haberetur,
his verbis: un massar suan nst,
rra ms nero· quare qui scripti
heredes erant, ab hereditate se ab·
stinebant3 et idcirco plerique intes-

tati moriebantur.

ξ 225. Itaque lata est lex Furia,
qua, exceptis personis quibusdam,
ceteris plus mille assibus legatorum
nomine mortisve causa capere per·
missum non est. sed ethaeo lex non
perfecit quod voluit. qui enim verbi
gratia quinque milium aeris patri-
monium habebat, poterat quinque
hominibus sing-ulis millenos asses
legando totum patrimonium ero-

gm-

5226. Ideo postea lata est lex
Voconia, qua cautum est, ne cui
plus legatorum nomine mortisve
causa capere liceret quam heredes
caperent. ex qua lege plane quidem
aliquid utique heredes habere vide·
bantur; sed tamen fere vitium si-
mile nascebatur: nam in multas
legatariorum personas distributo
patrimonio poterant adeo heredi
minimum relinquere, ut non expe-
diret heredi huius lucri gratia totius
hereditatis onera sustinere.

5227. Lata est itaque lex Fal-
cidia, qua -cautum est, ne sphs‘ ei
legare liceat quam dodrantem. ita-
que necesse est, ut heres quartam
partem hereditatis habeat. et hoc

nunc iure utimur.

bequeathed away, and nothing lest
to the heir but an empty title ς and
this privilege seemed granted by
the Twelve Tables, which concede
an unlimited power of testamentary
disposition, in these terma· ‘A
man' s last directions respecting his
property shall be enforeed by the
power of the state ε’ hence the per·
sons who were appointed heirs de-
clined to accept the inheritance, and
people commonly died intestato.

ξ 225. This led to the enactment
of the lex Furia, whereby‚ excepting
certain specified classes, a thousand
asses was made the maximum that
a legates or donee in contempla-
tion of death was permitted to
take. This law, however, failed to
accomplish its purpose, for a testa-
tor with an estate of, say, five thou-
sand asses, might leave to five le·
gatees a thousand asses apiece, and
strip the heir of the whole.

5226. This occasioned the en·
actment of the lex Voconia, provid-
ing that no legates or donee in con-
templation of death should take
more than the heir. By this law,
some portion at all events was
secured to the heir, but, like the
former, it could be defeated, for the
multitude of legatees between whom
a man distributed his estate might
leave so little to the heir as to make
it not worth his while to undertake
the whole burden of the succession.

522⁷. At last, the lex Falcidia
was enacted, prohibiting to bequeath
away more than three fourths of an
estate, in other words, securing for
the heir one fourth of the inherit-
anee‚ and this ι8 the rule of law now
in force.

ξ 228. The ensi-anchisement of
slaves was likewise kept within
limits hythe lex Furia Caninia, as
mentioned in the first volume of
these Institutione.
