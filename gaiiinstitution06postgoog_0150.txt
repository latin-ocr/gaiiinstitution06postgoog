persons already alieni juris. If remancipation is mentioned in ξ 162
it cannot mean remancipation to the natural father after the third
mancipation of a child in the process of emancipation or adop·
tion, ᾧ 134, for this remancipation involves no descent in status:
by the effect of the third mancipation the child is already in the
state of bondage, and after remancipation he continues in the same
state, without havIng descended to any lower stage in the hierarchy
of statue. The remancipation which operates a degradation must
be remancipation by the husband or coemptionator, whereby a
filiafamilias or woman in manu is reduced from that rank to the
lower standing of mancipium, ᾧῷ 115, 137, 195.

- In the translation of the text, and in the exposition of capitis
minuti0, and particularly of the third and last kind, I have
adopted the theory of Savigny as being the most tenable, and
forming the most harmonious system of legal conceptione. Ι must
now briefly notice an opposing theory, and the objections that may
be raised against that of Savigny. Some expositors hold that
capitis minutio minima did not necessarily and essentially involve
any degradation, any downward step on the ladder of status, but
might be merely a horizontal movement on the same platform, a
transit from family to family, a disruption of the ties of agnation,
a cessation of membership in a given civil group. 'I'his opinion is
founded on the authority of Paulus, undeniably an eminent juris
auctor, who defines the least diminution of head as follows : Capitis
deminutionis tria genera sunt, maxima, media, minima3 tria enim
sunt quae habemus, libertatem, civitatem, familiam. Igitur cum
omnia haec amittimus, hoc est, libertatem et civitatem et familiam, -
maximam esse capitis deminutionem3 cum vero amittimus civi-
tatem, libertatem retinemus, mediam esse capitis deminutionem3
cum et libertas et civitas retinetur, familia tantum mutatur, mini-
mam esse capitis deminutionem, constat, Dig. 4, 5, 11. ‘ Capital
diminution is of three orders, greatest, minor, least3 as there are
three things that we have, liberty, citizenship, family. 'Phe uni-
versal loss of freedom, citizenship, family, is the greatest capital
diminution: loss of citizenship while liberty is retained is minor
capital diminution ε when liberty and citizenship are retained, and
family only is changed, there is the least capital diminution.'
Consistently with this definition Paulus affirms that the children of
adrogatus suffer capitis minutio minima: Liberos qui arrogatum
parentem sequuntur, placet minui capite, quum in aliena potestate
