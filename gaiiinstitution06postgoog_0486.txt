464 DE OBL'IGATIONIBUS.

[111. ς 209.

thief vindicatio was the proper aetion. The object of the legis-
lator in allowing the plaintiff in any ease to sue by condictio was to
relieve him from the necessity of ascertaining whether his property
was safe or had been consumed. If we ask why, instead of using
the intenti0, Si paret dare oportere, 4 ξ 4, which might be inconsis-
tent with the truth, the plaintiff did not use the formula, Quidquid
paret dare faeere oportere, which, as including compensation or simple
restitution of possession, would always be consistent with truth3 the
answer is probably what Savigny has suggested, namely‚ the inten-
tion of the legislator to subject the defendant to the sponsio poenaliS,
the additional forfeiture of a third of the sum in litigation. It is
true that this is only mentioned as incidental to a condictio for
pecunia certa credita, 4 ᾗ 171, but the penalty may have also been
recoverable in a claim for certain money stolen (condictio furtiva).

Bethmann-Hollweg, ξ 95, proposes the following formula for
the actio furti nec manifesti:

Demonstratio .· Quod Numerius Negidius Aulo Agerio furtum feeit
paterae aureae,

Intentio .- Si paret ob eam rem Numerium Negidium Aulo Agerio
pro fure damnum decidere oportere (4 ᾗ 37),

Condemnatio .· Quanti paret eam rem fuisse, tantae pecuniae
duplum, judex, Numerium Negidium Aulo Agerio condemna: Si
non paret, absolve.

The plaintiff in theft had the option of proceeding by civil action
or by crimina] prosecution, and Ulpiau informs us that the latter
was the usual course, Dig. 47, 2, 94.

chargeable as theft, forfwho more
handles the property of another

denominated an audacious thies.
However, as a special remedy for
this offence the praetor has intro·
duced the action for rapine with
violence3 which may be brought
within a year for four times the
value, aster a year for simple
damages; and which lies when
only a single thing of the slightest
value has been taken with violence.
