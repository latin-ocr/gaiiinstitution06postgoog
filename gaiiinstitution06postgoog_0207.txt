quorum illis temporibus summa ob-

capion of land, and one year for the
usucapion of other things, an in-
heritance was held to fall under the
category of ‘other things,' as it is
neither land nor corporeal: and
though it was afterwards held that
the universal succession was not
acquirable by usucapion, yet the
component heredimments, including
land, continued acquirable by a
year's possession.

ξ 55. The motive for permitting
at all so unscrupulous an acquisi-
tion was the wish of the ancient
legislator to accelerate the accept-
ance of successions, and thus pro-
vide persons to perform the sacred
rites, to which in those days the
highest importance was attached,
and to ascertain the persons whom
creditore might sue for payment of
their claims.

ξ 56. This mode of acquisition
is sometimes called gratuitons usu-
capion, for the possessor has notice
of another's ownership.

ξ 57. In the present day, how·
ever, it is ineffectual, for the Senate
on the motion of Hadrian decreed
that such usucapione are revocable,
and the heir by sning for the in-
heritance may recover possession just
as if the property had never been
transmuted.

ξ 58. Even a necessary heir, how-
ever, by the civil law may lose por-
tions of his inheritance by this usu-
caplon.

§ 59. There are other conditions
under which a knowledge of an-
other’s ownership is no bar to usu-
capion. After a fiduciary manci·
pation or surrender of his property,
if the owner subsequently has pos-
session of it, he recovers his do-
minion even over land in the period
of a year, by what is called a pos-
sessive recovery, because a foregoing
dominion is thereby reacquired.
