The grant of civitas was either made to communities or to
individuale. It was a· lucrative sourse of revenue to the em-
perors. The fees to be paid were not small, Acts of the Apostles,
22, 28, and the new-made civis was regarded as a ‘manumitted slave
of the emperor, and was expected to remember the emperor in his
will. The philosophie emperor, Marcus Aurelius, under whom
Gaius flourished, granted the Roman franchise to all who were

Goths, Aa). 410. She was entered by Genseric, king of the Van-
dals, and, after a sack of fourteen days, left a heap of ruins, Aa).

before J ustinian made it acquirable by every form of manumission.
