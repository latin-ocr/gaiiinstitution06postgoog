petition for an adjudication of bankruptcy.

In order to understand the proceedings in bonorum emptio, or
execution against the property of an insolvent debtor, the principal
sanction of the Roman civil code in its later periods, we must stndy
the earlier mode of execution by manus injectio, or process against
the body of the debtor‚ which was one of the old legis actiones
regulated by the Twelve Tables, and which was the model on which
proceedings in missio in possessionem, or process against an insol-
vent's estate, were regulated by subsequent praetorian legislation [?]
These proceedings are known to us ΒΥ the statements of Aulus
Gellius, who has given us the very terms of the Twelve Tables.
Confessi igitur aeris ac debiti judicatis triginta dies sunt dati con-
quirendae pecuniae causa quam dissolverent, eosque dies decemviri
justos appellaverunt velut quoddam justitium, id est juris inter eos
quasi interstitionem quandam et cessationem, quibus diebus nihil
cum his agi jure posset. Post deinde nisi dissolverent, ad prae-

nervo aut compedibus, . . . Erat autem jus interea paciscendi, ac
nisi pacti forent habebantur in vinculis dies sexaginta. Inter eos
dies trinis nundinis continuis ad praetorem in comitium produce-

autem nundinis capite poenas dabant aut trans Tiberim peregre

plus minusve secuerunt, se fraude esto, Gellius, 20, 1. ‘ After an
admission of debt or a judgment the debtor was allowed thirty
