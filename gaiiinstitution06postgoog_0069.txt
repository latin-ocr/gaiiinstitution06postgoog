are artificia] aud accidental‚ the relations governed by the code of
the Family are natural, and essentia] to the existence of the human
racc: so much so that the principal relations of the family extend
to the rest of the animal world, and the portion of the code relating
to them is ‘called by Ulpian preeminently jus Naturale D. 1, 1, 3.
Secondly, whereas every feature of Property and Obligation is the
creation of political laW, Domestic life is only partially governed
by political law, which leaves the greater portion of its rights
and duties to be ruled by the less tangible dictates of the moral
law.

The pure law of the Family, that is, when we exclude all consi-
deration of Property and Obligation relating to property, is of very
moderate compass: but with the pure code of the family it is cou-
venient to aggregate what we may call with Savigny, ᾧ 57, 1116
applied code of the Family, i. e. such of the laws of Property and
Obligation as concern members of the family group—husband and
wife, parent and child, guardian and ward. The main divisione
then of the substantive code are Family law Pure and Applied 3 the
law of Property3 and the law of Obligation. If, in view of its im-
portance, we separate from the law of Property the law of Rerum
Universitates, confining the law of Property to the province of Res
singulae, we may add to the three we have enumerated a fourth

division, the law of Successions.
