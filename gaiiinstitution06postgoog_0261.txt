11. §§ 123-137.] CONTRA-TABULAR POSSESSION. 239

to ascendants or descendants of the testator, or a bequest to the
wife of the dower which she had brought to her husband. If,
instead of making the conjuncta persona a legatee, the testator had
given his bounty in the form of a portion of the succession in which
the conjuncta persona was instituted successor, such institution con-
tinued valid. The valiffity, however, of such legacies and institu-
tions was by a constitution of Antoninus Pius, D. 37, 5, ’7, (possibly
the same as the rescript mentioned by Gaius ξ 120, ξ 126 b)
subjected to this limitation, that all the conj unctae personae to-
gether could not take more than 8 virilis portio, i. 9. as much as
fell 10 1119 101 of the eontra-tabulant or claimant of contra-tabular
possession3 with this further proviso, that any conjuncta persona
who is instituted heir in 8 portion of the heritage may retain as
much thereof as 119 would have obtained by claiming contra-tabular
possession.

The partial intestacy produced by contra-tabular possession shows
that the rule which we have already quoted: nemo pro parte tes-
tatus pro parte intestatus decedere potest: must 119 taken with
some reservation. Although 8 testator cannot voluntarily dispose
of only part of his heritage, such partial disposition may be intro·
duced against the testator's intention by the operation of law. The
ngnificance of the rule is principally this: that if a testator only
names a successor for a certain fraction of the heritage: or if the
fraction devised to one of several successors lapses by his decease
before the testator's death, the undevised or lapsed portion does not
devolve, 89 it would in English law, to the heirs-at—law or persons
entitled by intestacy, but goes by accrual (accretio) to the devisee
or devisees of the remainder of the heritage.

In ξ 135 a Gaius explained the effect of nova clausula J uliani,
D. 37, 8, which attempted to reconcile the civil claims of uneman-
cipated grandchildren, who at civil law were the immediate suc-
cessore of their grandfather, with the natural claims of their
emancipated father, who by emancipation had lost his civil rights
in the heritage of the testator. By the clause which Salvius
Julianus introduced into the Edict, if a son is emancipated and
grandchildren by him continue in the power of a testator, the
grandchildren are entitled in contra-tabular- possession to one moiety
of what their father would have taken by descent had he continued
unemancipated‚ and their father 10 1119 other moiety. This however
is only the rule when the son is emancipated and 1119 grandchildren
