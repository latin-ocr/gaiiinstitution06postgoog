is in another person, called jura in re or jura in re aliena, rights
which fall short of absolute property but approximate to it in
various degrees. Such are servitudes, mortgage (pignus), super-
ficies, and emphyteusis, These may all be regarded as detached
fractions of property, portione of the right of dominion taken from
the proprietor and vaeted in another person. They are explained
by Justinian in the parallel passage of his Institutes, and, though
not mentioned by Gaius, demand here a brief notice.

Servitudes are (1) praedial or real (praediorum), that is, belong to
a person as owner of a certain house or land (praedium dominans)
in respect of a house or land belonging to another proprietor (prae-
dium serviens)‚ or (2) personal (personarum), tbat is, are vested in
a person without relation to his ownership of praedium dominans,
(Compare in English law the division of easements into easements
appurtenant to land and easements in gross.)

Praedial servitudes are servitudes properly so called and are con-

Property is a right against the world which gives to the party in
whom 'it resides a power of dealing with the subject which is not
capable of exact definition. Servitude is such a right against the

subject which is susceptible of precise description. It is a definite
subtraction from the indefinite powers of use and exclusion which
reside in the proprietor3 or a right against the owner and the rest of
the world to make certain use of a thing or prohibit certain uses.

Praedial servitudes are (1) rustic, relating to land, or (2) urban,
relating to houses. Urban servitudes are further subdivided into
Positive or Affirmative and Privative or Negative. The following
considerations will show the meaning of this division and its origin
in the nature of Property.

Servitudes are limitatione of, or deductions from, another person’s
ownership or' dominion. Dominion contains, among other clemente,
(A) certain powers of action (jus utendi), and (B) certain powers of
exclusion (jus prohibendi). Restrictions on these powers will be
(a) a certain necessitas non utendi, and (b) a certain necessitas
patiendi. correlative to these obligations on the part of the owner
of the servient tenement will be certain rights of the owner of the

γ dominant tenement, viz. (a) a certain jus prohibend‚ and (β) a

certain jus utendi, or in other words, (a) a certain negative servitude,
and (β) a certain affirmative servitude. As it happens that all the
