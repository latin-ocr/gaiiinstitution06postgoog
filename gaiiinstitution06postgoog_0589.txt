tarius procurator petam quod ipse cui debes se incommodo exacturum
negat. At vero inquam, tibi ego, Brute, non solvam nisi prius a·
te cavero amplius eo nomine neminem cujus petitio sit petiturum,
Brutus, 4. ‘ I too, said Brutus, must wait for what Atticus is pro-
mised, but perhaps I shall sue as volunteer procurator for the
payment, which the principal says he will leave to your con-
venience. Then I shall not pay you, Brutus, said Ι, unless you
first give me security that no one entitled to sue shall sue me on
that account a second time.’ ·

ᾗ 102. The husband sued for the dower of his divorced wife might
retain a portion on various groundS, of which Immorality was one.
Retentiones ex dote fiunt aut propter liberos, aut propter mores,
aut propter impensas, aut propter res donatas, aut propter res amotas.
Propter liberos retentio fit, si culpa mulieris aut patris in cujus po-
testate est divortium factum sit: tunc enim singulorum liberorum
nomine sextae retinentur ex dote3 non plures tamen quam tres . . . .
Morum nominc graviorum quidem sexta retinetur3 leviorum autem
octava. Graviores mores sunt adulteria tantum3 leviores omnes
reliqui, Ulpian, Liber Regularum, 6, 9. ‘ Retentions in the resti-
tution of dower are on account of children, immorality, expenditure‚
donation, articles purloined by the wife. On account of children, if
the fault of the wife, or the father in whose power she ie, occasioned
the divorce. 'I'hen a sixth is retained on account of each child, but not
more than three sixths altogether. For gross immorality a sixth is
retained, for slight immorality an eighth. Only adultery is gross
immorality.'

The circumstances under which security judicatum solvi was
required of a defendant are illustrated in Cicero's oration for
Quintius. Naevius had a demand against Quintius, and alleged
that Quintius had committed an act of bankruptcy by breaking an‘
engagement to appear before the praetor (vadimonium judicio sisti),
and on this ground obtained from the praetor a missio in posses-
sionem in pursuance of the edict. Praetor ait: In bona ejus qui
judicio sistendi causa fidejussorem dedit, si neque potestatem sui
faciat neque defendetur, iri jubeb0, Dig. 42, 4, 2. ‘If a defendant
give security to appear and neither appears nor is defended, I will
put the plaintiff in possession of his goods.' Accordingly, when
Quintius was afterwards willing to defend an action, Naevius
required that he should give security judicatum solvi, ξ 103.
Defendere debitorem sicut ante quam bona ejus possiderentur licet,
