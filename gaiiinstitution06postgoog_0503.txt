111. ξς 220-225.] POSSESSION. 481

the authorities we have quoted, and must be regarded as an in·
exactitude of Ulpian. Misled by Ulpian, Sir william Jones in
his treatise on Bailments lays down the principle that, when a
contract is reciprocally beneficial‚ only ordinary diligence is re-
quire-d, whereas we have shown that if the interests of the parties
are not identical, the Roman law, at least, requires extraordinary
diligence. ‚

He also, in measuring diligence and negligence, introduces the
conception of a mean and two extremes, making three gradatione
of diligence (and correspondingly of negligence), ordinary dili-
gence, less than ordinary diligence, more than ordinary diligence:
but this tripartite division produces an intricacy and complication
that is not to be found in the Roman juristS.

Under the head of Obligatio ex delicto should be placed, ac-
cording to Savigny, the doctrine of POSSESSION (Interdict-possession),
or, rather, of Dispossession, with its remedieS, the Interdicts Utrubi‚
Uti possidetis, and Unde vi. This would agree with the Roman
arrangement ε at least the Roman jurists, instead of recognizing in
Possession a primary right, imposing a negative obligation on all
the world (jus in rem), were content with regarding Dispossession
as a wrong imposing a secondary positive obligation on the indi-
vidual dispossessor‚ and treated all the possessory Interdicts as
actions ex delicto, 4 ᾧ 140, commentary.

But the true place of Possession seems indicated by Vangerow
who distinguishes between the Interdicta Retinendae and Recu-
perandae possessionis· The Interdictum Recuperandae possessionis,
i. e. the Interdict Unde vi, is really based on obligatio ex maleficiO,
and belongs to Penal jurisprudenee: whereas Possession as con-
templated by the Interdicta Retinendae possessionis, i. e. the In·
terdicta Uti possidetis and Utrubi‚ is a primary right demanding
universal recognition (jus in rem) that has its place in the code re-
gulating Dominion: and the interdicte allotted for its protection,
though nominally based on obligatio ex delicto are really coordinata
not with Penal actions, but with Real actions or VindicatiO. Gaius
only deals with Possession and possessory Interdicts as belonging to
the code of Procedure, without indicating their position in the code
of substantive law.
