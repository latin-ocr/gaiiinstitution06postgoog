608 DE ACTIONIBUS. [iv. §§ 115-137.

ΒΥ formula), is probably the reason why the second line of defence
as well as the third is treated as an exceptio in modern Ger-
many.

The distinction between counteractive and destructive plens
does not seem to have had much influence on English pleading.
Stephens in his CommentarieS, V. 10, admits that all pleas are not
necessarily either traverses or pleas in avoidance3 and, as an in·
stance of a plea that falls under neither class, mentions pleas by
way of estoppel. One species of estoppel, estoppel by record, is
the Roman exceptio rei judicatae: so that here we find recognized
a third class of plea under which we might have expected that
other averments analogous to other Roman exceptions· would be
ranged. We find, however, the pleas of the statute of limitatione
(prescription) and of set-off (compensatio) given as instancae of
pleae in discharge, i. e. of what we have called the second line of
defense, or pleas in avoidance. [For the general theory of Exceptio,
see Savigny, ᾧῷ 202, 203, 226-229.]

Ι proceed to notice some of the points incidentally mentioned by
Gaius.

'Phe denial ΒΥ a defendant that he had received money from a
plaintiff would not, in an actio Mutui‚ appear on the fuce of the
formula: as a simple Negation of the plaintiff's right, it would fall
under the first line of defence. It would only assume the form
of Exceptio pecuniae non numeratae, ᾧ 116, in an action brought
on a Stipulation. Here the promise of the defendant to repay
would establish a right of the plaintiff: but the absence of a
previous payment by the plaintiff would give the defendant a
countervailing right, to be alleged in an exceptio. In this ex-
ception the burden of proof was not, as in other cases, on the
defendant but on the plaintiff‚ Cod, 4, 30, 3: but aster a certain
period, fixed by Marcus Aurelius at five years, reduced by J us-
tinian to two, Cod. 4, 30, 14, the production of the document
(cautio) in which the stipulation was recorded was a sufficient
proof that the plaintiff had performed this antecedent condition.
During these five or two yearS, accordingly, the effect of formal
contracts, whether verbal (verbis) or literal (literis), was virtually
suspended in the case of a money loan: for the plaintiff had to
prove his execution of the consideration, that is, a formless or real

contract (re), and was not entitled to recover on mere proof of formal
contract by stipulatio or expensilatio.
