stipulation, and other conti-acts. It is true that in the Code and
Digest we often also find it apparently equivalent to chirographum
or some other kind of literal conti-act, binding simply by its form 3
e. g. Si quasi accepturi mutuam pecuniam adversario cavistis quae
numerata non est, per condictionem obligationem repetere, etsi
actor non petat, vel exceptione non numeratae pecuniae adversus
agentem uti potestis, Cod. 4, 30, ’7. ‘ If you gave your adversary
an acknowledgment of debt in contemplation of a loan which was
not advanced‚ you may force him by action to deliver up the obli-

gation if he delays to sue upon it, or may bar his claim by excep-
tion of money not advanced if he sues? It would be necessary to
have the instrument surrendered, because after two years it would be
conclusive evidence of debt. But in J ustinian's time, with perhaps
the exception of S yngrapha, there was no Literal contract. The
action in which a plaintiff would gain his cause by production of
a CautiO, would be either a condictio MUTUI, i. e. founded not on a
Literal or Formal, but on a REAL or Formless obligation (annume-
ratio), or a condictio certi ex STIPULA'HONE, founded on the binding
force of wenna.

It may assist us in understanding the distinction of Formless
and Formal contracta, Verbal and Literal‚ if, before we quit this
subject, we cast a hasty glauce at the corresponding institutione
of English law.

In the eye of the English law, contracts are either Simple (parol),
that is, enforceable only on proof of consideration, or Special, that
is, binding by the solemnity of their form. Special contracts are
either contracts under Seal or contracta of Record. A common
species of Deed, or written contract under seal, is the Bond or
Obligation, which, like Stipulatio, is used to secure the payment
of money or performance of any other act, and, like Stipulati0‚
either binds the debtor alone or the debtor and sureties. It con-
sists of an obligatory part or penal clause, and a condition added,
that if the obligor does some particular act the obligation shall
be void, but else shall remain in full force.

Contracta of Record are either recognizances or J udgment debts.

A Recognizance is an acknowledgment before a court or magi-
strate that a man owes the Queen or a private plaintiff (as the case
may be) a certain sum of money, with a condition avoiding the
obligation to pay if he shall do some particular act, as, if he shall
appear at the assizes‚ keep the peace, pay a cert-ain debt, or the like.
