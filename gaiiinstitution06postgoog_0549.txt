number of his neighbours 3 of which institution we have a vestige
in the Wager of law, which was recently an incident of the action of
Detinue, in which the defendant might clear himself by his own
oath and that of eleven compurgators. With such principles of Evi-
dence it is not surprising that in the German forests the struggle
between litigante was not, who should escape the burden of proof
but, who should enjoy the privilege of proof. The Roman method
was not so liable to abuse. Either litigant might tender (deferre,
delatio) an oath to his adversary, i. e. offer to be eoncluded by his
adversary’s oath, on an issue either of fact or of law (obligation,
property, succession, &c.). 'I'he oath was then equivalent to a
judgment in favour of the person by whom it was sworn. If a
litigant was prepared to take an oath his adversary might release
him from actually swearing (dare, praestare, jusjurandum); but
this release (remittere, remissio) was equivalent to an actual oath.
Instead of taking a tendered oath, the adversary might make a
counter-tender (referre, relatio), i. e. submit the issue to the oath
of the original tenderer. 'I'o decline either to swear or to make a
counter- tendet was equivalent to a confession of the party who de-
clined, or to an oath of the party who tendered. From this neces-

sity imposed on the party to whom it was tendered, the oath was
called jusjurandum necessarium, Dig. 12, 2, 34, 6. If now on a
tendet or counter-tender by a defendant a plaintiff swore to the
justice of his claim, the assessment of damages (rei aestimatio)
would still remain as a question for the judex, and the praetor

would give him a formula. consisting, as above, of a. Demonstratio
and a Condemnatio.

ξ 45. A formula is framed to
embrace an allegation of law when
we declare ourselves proprietors by
the law of the Quirites, or essert

cases we appeal to a principle of
civil law.

a fact, proceeds at once to the Gon-
