emancipated son are excluded from
any portion of the contra- tabular
succession by the prior right of
their father, whether they are eman-
cipated or unemancipated [D. 37,
8, 1, 6. Whereas unemancipated
grandchildren by an emancipated
son take one moiety and their
emancipated father takes the other
moiety of the share which he
would have taken by intestacy
had he not been emmcipated,
D. 37, 8, 1, 11.]

§ 136. A'doptlve children, so long
as they continue in the power of the
adoptive father, have the rights of his
natural children t but when eman-
cipated by the adoptive father they
neither at civil law nor in the Praetor’s
edict are regarded as his children.

ξ 137. And conversely in respect
of their natural father as long as
they continue in the adoptive family
they are strangers: but when eman·
cipated by the adoptive father they

have the same rights in their natural
family as they would have had if
emancipated by their natural father
(that is, unless either instituted
heirs or disinherited by him, may
claim the contra-tabular succession.)

mancipati fuissent.

ξ 123. The necessity of disinheriting a suus heres is grounded
on the principle of primitive law, that the child is co-proprietor
with the parent: hence, unless something occurs to divest the
child of his property, he will simply become sole proprietor by
survivorship on the death of his father. In suis heredibus evi-
dentius apparet, continuationem dominii eo rem perducere, ut nulla
videatur hereditas fuisse, quasi olim hi domini essent, qui etiam
vivo patre quodammodo domini existimabantur. Unde etiam filius-
familias appellatur, sicut paterfamilias, sola nota hac adjecta, per
quam distinguitur genitor ab eo qui genitus sit. Itaque post
mortem patris non hereditatem percipere videntur, sed mag-is
