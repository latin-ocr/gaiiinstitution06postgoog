interdictS, and an action on contract: Commodans had only his
action on contract, · for interdicte, as we have stated, were not em·
“ ployed m matters of contractual obligation.

ξ 156. Paulus mentioned a fourth class of interdicta, namely,
those for either acquiring or recovering possession. Sunt etiam
interdicta duplicia tam recuperandae quam adipiscendae possessionis,
Dig. 43, 1, 2, 3. These are the restitutory interdictS, Quem fundum,
Quam hereditatem, Quem usumfructum, which have been already
quoted, ξ 89, whereby, if the defendant in a real action refused to
give security judicatum solvi, possession was transferred to the plain-
tiff, who in some cases would acquire, in others recover possession.
Quem fundum was the interdict employed in Vindicatio: Quam
hereditatem in Hereditatis petitio: Quem usumfructum in the vin-
dication of a Personal servitude. In interdict procedure, instituted
for the retention of possession, analogous functions were performed
by further interdicts called interdicta Secundaria, ξ 170.

Pending litigation respecting Urban servitudes the plaintiff was
protected by a peculiar institution, the interdictum Demolitorium
based on Operis novi nuntiatiO, the nature of which demands a
passing notice. If A, a proprietor or owner of some real right
(mortgagce, emphyteuta, superficiarius), was aggrieved by some ar-
chitectural innovation (aedificatio, demolitio) on the part of B,
whereby an urban servitude over the tenement of A was asserted
or some servitude belonging to A, as owner of a dominant tenement‚
was violated, A was entitled to serve a formal inhibition or private
injunction on B (prohibitio, operis novi nuntiatio) summoning him
to desist from the innovation. On this summons B was bound to
desist from his work until he obtained from the praetor adissolution'
or discharge of the sumnions (remissiO, missam facere nuntiationem):
which discharge, except under certain special circumstances, could
only be obtained by B’s entering into a satisdatio or cautio de de-
moliend0, security that the structure should be demolished in the
event of A as plaintiff succeeding in a future actio Negatoria or
Confessoria, i. e. establishing his own jus prohibendi, which would
be the same as disproving B's jus aedificandi. If without ob-
taining such remissio B persisted in his work, he was compelled to
demolish it by the interdictum 'Demolitorium. If he desisted from
the work for the present, but refused to oppose A’s suit in the
regular course by entering into satisdatio judicatum solvi, it was
the duty of the j udge to compe] him to enter into a stipulation
