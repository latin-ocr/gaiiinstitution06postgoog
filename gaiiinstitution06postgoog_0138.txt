amount of parental power: the
assent of the holder in mancipation
is also necessary to manumission by
entry on the censor’s register when
a delinquent son has been surren-
dered by his father in consequence
of a noxal suit 3 when, for instance,
the father has been condemned in
an action for a theft committed by
the son, and has by mancipation

surrendered his son to the plaintiff ¹

in lieu of pecuniary damages.

ξ 141. Finally‚ it is to 116 observed
that contumelious treatment of a
person held in mancipation is not
permitted, but rendere liable to an
6611011 of outrage; and the 616166
generally is not persistent, but
merely formal and momentary, ex-
cept when it is the consequence of

ᾧ 137. Dissolution of marriage was either by the consent of both
parties (divortium) 01· by the act of one (repudium). 'Phe message of
repudiation contained the formula, Tuas res tibi habet0‚ ‘ Take away
thy property.’ Mimam illam suam 6666 res sibi habere jussit, claves
ademit, exegit, Cic. Phil. 2, 28. ‘The actress was ordered to pack,
deprived of the keys, turned out of the house.' The lex J ulia de
adulteriis prescribed a form for repudium, and required the message
to be delivered by a freedman of the family, in the presence of
seven witnesses above the age of puberty and citizens of Rome.
The party who made a 6611661666 repudium, or whose misconduct
justified a repudium, was punished by pecuniary losses in respect of
dos and propternuptial donatione. After much veering legislation
in later 111666, J ustinian enacted that a man or woman who divorced
without a cause should retire to a cloister and forfeit all his or her

estate, one moiety to his or her successore, and the other moiety to
the cloister. Nov. 134, 11.

ᾧ 140. Ihering, ᾅ32, infers from this that the censue, like a year
of jubilee, freed all but noxal and fictitious bondsmen at the end of
five years: and that the Twelve Tables, in limiting a father to three

mancipatione, disabled him from selling the services of his son for
more than fifteen years.
