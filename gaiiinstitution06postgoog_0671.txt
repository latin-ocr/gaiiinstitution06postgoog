ex his quae edicto perpetuo vel magistratu fieri praecipiuntur vel
fieri prohibentur, Modestinus, Dig. 44, 7, 52, 6. ‘ The ordinance of
the magistrate is the source of an obligation in matters which the
annual edict or the magistrate enjoins or forbids.' Interdicta omnia,
licet in rem videantur concepta, vi tamen ipsa personalia sunt,
Ulpian, Dig. 43, 1, 3. ‘ All interdicts, though impersonal (Real) in
terms, are in substance Personal actions?

'Phe party against whom judgment was given in interdict pro-
cedure was found guilty of having committed a delict3 that is, of
having disobeyed the mandate contained in the interdict of the
magistrate. Interdict procedure then belonged to the class of
penal or delictual actions. That the possessory interdicts 111 par-
ticular (Utrubi, Uti possidetis, and Unde vi) were classed with
actions ex delicto, appears from the fact that they were only main-
tainable against the wrong-doer within· a year from their nativity,
Dig. 43, 17, 1 pr. 3 Dig. 43, 16, 1 pr.; and were only maintainable
against the heir of the wrong-doer so far as he was enriched by the
wrong of his predecessor (quatenus ad eum pervenit . . . . ut tamen

'I'he right of a person who has been dispossessed to be reinstated
in possession is a secondary right based on the violation of some
primary right. What was the nature of that primary right? Ac-
cording to Savigny it was the right of a freeman to be exempt from
violence or corporeal molestation3 not the right of a possessor to
continue in possession. He denies, that is, that the fact of Pos-
session is 8 11118 investing the possessor with a Real right to con-
tinue in possession3 and bases the right of reinstatement on an-
other Real right, one of the rights that we have called Primordial,
the right to immunity from corporea] violence.

'I'he classical jurists seem to have evaded the question. 'I'he
delict adj udicated upon in interdict procedure is in form the
violation of a public duty, the duty of obedience to the magistrate.
'l'hat it was in substance the violation of a private or civil right
of a person who has been dispossessed did not appear on the face
of the proceedings3 and consequently the nature of this right
had not 10 be investigated.

Considering that possession involved 8 right against the world to
freedom from molestatiom remembering, further, the old division of
Real actions in English law into Possessory and Droitural, and
