1.§§ 159-164.] DE CAPITIS MINUTIONE. 129

sint et familiam mutaverint, Dig. 4, 5, 3. ‘ The children who
follow an adrogated parent suffer diminution of head, as they are
dependent and have changed family.' Here, then, if Paulus is
right, we have capitis minutio without any degradation‚ any loss of
rank3 for-the children of adrogatus have the same status of filii-
familias after their father's adrogation as they had before, although
in a different family. The proposition, however, that the children
of adrogatus suffer capitis minutio is not confirmed by any other
jurist, and Savigny supposes that the doctrine was peculiar to
Paulus, and was in fact inaccurate. Another objection to the
theory of Savigny‚ though not so serious as the opposing authority
⁷ of PauluS, is presented by the operation of in manum conventio.

When an independent woman made a coemption she undoubtedly
declined in status, as before coemption she was sui juris, and after

coemption she is filiafamilias, But a filiafamilias who made a
coemption apparently suffered no degradation: the definitive result
of the coemption leaves her, as before, filiafamilia5‚ and that,
apparently, without having passed through any lower stage3 for
Gaius expressly says that the lex mancipii, or formula of mancipa-
tion in coemptinn, was not calculated to reduce the woman to a
servile condition, ᾧ 123. Gaius tells us, however, that coemption
operates a capitis minutio, ᾧ 162, without limiting the effect to the
case of a woman sui juris. The operation of coemption to produce
capitis minutio is also mentioned ΒΥ Ulpian, and again without any
express limitation to the case of an independent woman: Minima
capitis diminutio est per quam, et civitate et libertate mlva, status
- dumtaxat hominis mutatur3 quod fit adoptione et in manum con-
ventione, 11, 13. ‘ There is least capital diminution when both
franchise and freedom are unimpaired‚ and only position in house-
hold life is changed, as occurs in adoption and subjection to hand.'
If filiafamilias underwent capitis minutio when she made a coemp-
tion, her case disproves our theory that all capitis minutio requires
degradation: but Savigny assumes that, though in these passages
there is no express limitation to the case of independent women, yet
this limitation must be understood 3 and there is nothing outrageous
in this supposition.

While, however, these objections to the hypothesis of Savigny
are doubtless serious, on the other hand they are compensated by
legal facts which are absolutely irreconcilable with the adverse
hypothesis, the cases of Flamen Dialis and Virgo Vestalis, Virgo
