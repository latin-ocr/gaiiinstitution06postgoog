the bulla aurea which they wore round their neck, on the first
Liberalia, the l7th March, Ovid, Fasti, 3, 771, aster the completion
of their fourteenth year. Females did not lay aside the praetexta till
their marriage. Antoninus Pius permitted the adrogation of youths
below the age of puberty (impubes, investis) under certain con-
ditions3 e. g. the adrogatur entered into a stipulation‚ originally
with a public slave, in later times with a public notary (tabularius),
in the event of the death of adrogatus before the age of puberty, to
restore his estate to his natural heire, and, in the event of emanci-
pation, to adrogatus himself: and adrogatus became entitled to a
fourth part of the estate of adrogator (called quarta Antonini), of
which he could not be deprived by disinherison or by unmerited
emancipation. In the time of J ustinian the adrogator only acquired
in any case an usufruct or life estate in the property of adrogatus,
which reverted to adrogatus after the death of adrogator3 that is to
say, the property of adrogatus was transformed by adrogation into
peculium adventicium.

The form of adoption is explained below, ξ 134, under the head of
dissolution of patria potestas, for as patria potestas is vested by
adoption in the adoptive father, so it is divested from the natural
father. 'I'he contrasted forms of adrogation and adoption are men-
tioned in juxtaposition by Suetonius: Gaium et Lucium adoptavit,
domi per assem et libram emptos a patre Agrippa . . . Tertium
nepotem Agrippam simulque privignum Tiberium adoptavit in foro
lege curiata, Augustus, 64. ‘ Augustus adopted his daughter's sons,
Gaius and Lucius, by (fictitious vindication after) a private convey-
ance by bronze and balance from their father Agrippa. His third
grandson Agrippa and his stepson Tiberius he adrogated in the
forum by a law of the Comitia Curiata.' These eomitia had long
been merely fictitious forms, the thirty curiae being symbolized by
thirty lictors.

'Phe effect of adoption was much reduced by a constitution of
J ustinian„ If the adoption was by an ascendent, maternal or
paternal, it retained its old character: but if it was by a stranger
it neither created nor extinguished patria potestas3 it did not
transfer the adopted son from his old family into a new family, and
therefore it neither destroyed nor created any tie of agnation: its
only effect was to give to the adoptive son, in the event of intestacy,
a claim against the estate of the intestato adoptive father3 cod. 8,
48, 10. -
