364 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [111. §§ 90, 91.

fictions of a loan and ground to support Condictio certi, they did
not resemble it in rendering the judicatus in such a condictio liable,
on default of satisfying the judgment, to personal execution.

The arrangement adopted by Gaius is not without significance.
He begins with a Real, that is, a Formless contract‚ found in the
code of Natural law: and from these Real contracte he selects
Mutuum, the type, that is to say, which Formal contracts sub-
sequently imitated and feigned. He then proceeds to Formal
contracte, Verbal and Litera13 and concludes with the remaining·
class of Formless contracte, namely the Consensual. This is per-
haps the chronological, as well as the logical„ order in which
contracte were developed.

QUIBUS noma RE CONTBAHATUR OBLIGATIO.

ᾗ 90. Re contrahitur obligatio
velut mutui datione. quae proprie
in his fere rebus contingit quae [res]
pondere, numero, mensura constant .-
qualis est pecunia numerata, vinum,
oleum, frumentum, aes, argentum,
aurum. quas res aut numerando
aut metiendo aut pendendo in hoc
damuS, ut accipientium fiant et
quandoque nobis non eadem, sed
alia eiusdem naturae reddantur:
unde etiam mutuum appellatum est,
quia quod ita tibi a me datum est
ex meo tuum fit.

ξ 91. Is quoque quinon debitum
accepit ab eo qui per errorem solvit
re obligatur. nam proinde ei con-
dici potest s1 raam· sum 11118111
oron‘rnnn, ac si mutuum accepisset.
unde quidam putant pupillum aut
mulierem cui sine tutoris auctori-
tate non debitum per errorem datum
est non teneri condictione, non magis
quam mutui datione. sed haec spe-
cies obligationis non videtur ex
contractu consistere, quia is qui sol-
vendi animo dat magis distrahere
vult negotium quam contrahere.

ᾗ 90. Of real contracts, or con-
tracta created by performance, we
have an example iu loan for con-
sumption, or loan whereby property
is transferred. This chiefly relates
to things which are estimated by
weight, number, or measure, such
as money, wine, oil, corn, bronze,
silver, gold. We transfer our pro-
perty in these on condition that the
receiver shall transfer back to us
at a future time, not the same
things, but other things of the same
nature: and this contract is called
Mutuum, because thereby meum be·-
comes tuum.

ξ 91. The receiver of what was
not owed from a person who pays
in error is also under a real obliga-
tion, for 110 may be sued by Con-
dictio with the formula: ‘ If it be
proved that he ought to convey‚’
just as if he had received the pro-
perty in pursuance of 8 10811. And,
accordingly, some have held that
8 ward or female, if their guardian
has not authorized them to receive
a payment, are not liable to be sued
for money paid in error any more
than they are 'for money received
as 8 10811. This, however, is a mis·

take, aa the liability is not founded
