business, It is called Institoria
because the manager of a shop is
called Institor, and it is brought for
the whole amount.

§ 72. The edict provides another
action, called Tributoria‚ in respect
of the part of the Peculium which
is devoted to a certain trade carried
on by a son or slave with the know·
ledge of his father or master. If
any debts are contracted in that
trade the praetor orders this portion
of the Peculium and its profits to
be distributed between the father or
master and other creditors in pro·
portion to their claime, and charges
the father or master with the dis-
tribution3 and any creditor who
complains that he has received less
than his share can bring this action.

§⁷3. There is also an action in
respect of Peculium and of what has
been converted to the uses of the
father or master. When a debt is
contracted without the consent of
the father or master, if any portion
was conver-ted to his uses, he is
liable to that amount ς if no portion
was converted, he is liable to the
extent of the peculium. Conversion
to his uses is any necessary expen-
diture on his account, as payment
of his creditore, repen-of his falling
house, purchase of corn for his
slaves, purchase of an estate sor him,
or any other necessary. If out of
ten thousand sesterces which your
slave horrowed of Titius he paid
your creditor five thousand, and
spent the remainder m some other
way, you are liable sor the whole
of the five thousand, and for the
remainder to the extent of the pe-
culium. If the whole ten thousand
was applied to your uses you are
liable for the whole. It is a single
action that is brought in respect of
