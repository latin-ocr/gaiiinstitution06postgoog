a tendency to uniformity of taxation commenced: the distinction
of tributary and stipendiary provinces was merely nominal in the
time of Gaius, and it ceased entirely in the time of Pomponius and
Ulpian. As early, probably, as from the time of Marcus Aurelius,
under whom Gaius flourished‚ the following system of direct taxation
was uniformly established throughout the Roman world.

Direct taxation was of two kinds : it embraced (1) a poll tax or
capitation tax, i. e. a tax on persons (capitis tributum), and (2) a
tax on land (agri tributum). 'Phe tax on persons (capitatio humana)
was a fixed sum, probably of small amount, that was only levied on
persons who were not liable to the land tax, on tributarii as opposed
to possessores It was chiefly contributed by three classes, (1) tenant ·
fai-mers of a semi-servile condition (coloni), (2) artisans and labourers,
(3) slaves. From this capitation tax were exempted all who had the
rank of municipal senators (decuriones, curialeS, ordo), even though
they were not possessore& From the classes on whom it was levied,
capitatio humana was sometimes called capitatio plebeia.

The tax on landholders (possessores) was also called capitation
(capitatio terrena). 'Phe reason of this will appear when we explain
the mode in which it was levied. The whole territory was ideally
divided into units of taxation (capita, juga), districts varying in size
according to the nature of the soil, each having an estimated
capital value of 1000 solidi or aurei, and hence called millena.
From these capita or juga the land tax derived its name of capitatio
or jugatio, 'Phe list of capita was called a Cadastre (capitastrum)‚
and was revised every fifteen years (one of the earliest land valua-
tions, made by order of Augustus, is mentioned by St. Luke, 2, 1).
Every year, as soon as the Minister of Finance had settled the
budget of expenditure‚ proclamation (indicti0‚ delegatio) was made
of the amount of taxes required, or rather, the total being divided
by the number of capita, of the amount to be paid by each caput.
Each caput paid the same sum. 'Phe financial year commenced on
lst of September3 and the tax was payable in three instalments‚
on the lst days of the following J anuary, May, and September.
Besides the money tax, and proportioned to it, landowners had
to pay a certain tax in raw produce (annona).

Italy and the privileged towns that enjoyed J us Italicum were
exempt from both these forms of direct taxation; jus Italicum
consisting, as we have stated, of three clemente, (1) free municipal
constitution, (2) capacity in the soil of quiritary ownership‚ and (3)
