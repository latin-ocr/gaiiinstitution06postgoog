deletion of the inheritance and vaeancy of possession. This pos·
session, which Gaius (§ 52) calls pro herede (see Dig. 5, 3, 9), is more
properly called pro possessore. Pro possessore vero possidet praedo,
qui interrogatus cur possideat, responsurus sit, quia possideo, neo
contendit se heredem vel per mendacium, nee ullam causam posses-
sionis possit dicere, ibid. ‘ Possessor, as possessor, is the occupant,
who, asked why he possesseS‚ answers, ‘⁸ Because I possess, ” and does
not claim to be heir even mendaciously‚ and has no title of possession
to allege.' The constitution of Hadrian (Se. J uventiannm D. 5, 3,
20, 6) did not prevent the usucapion‚ but made it nugatory by allow-
ing the heir to recover the hereditaments by real action (hereditatis
petitio, or the interdict Quorum bonorum) , just as if the usucapion had
never been completed. The word ‘ however,'§ 58, appears to be an
admission of Gaius, that the reason he has suggested for this excentrie
rule, the wish to ascertain speedily the person bound to perform the
sacred rites and to satisfy the creditore, is inadequate, as the seizure
and usucapion was permitted even when an enfranchised slave was
heir, when, that is to say, the alleged motive could not operate, as
a manumitted slave is a necessary and immediate successor. In-
deed, in 3 § 201, Gaius speaks as if it were exclusively against the
enfranchised slave, and not against the voluntarius heres, that this
mode of acquisition was permitted by the law 3 but his language ad-
mits of explanation. Gaius is there illustrating the proposition that
a man may acquire by usucapion a thing which he is aware already
has a proprietor. Now in the interval before a heres voluntarius has
accepted the succession, the interval during which strangers would be
most likely to seize portione of the inheritance, these portione would
be res nullius, ᾧ 9, would have no proprietor‚ and therefore could not
illustrate the proposition that res aliena, i.e. res alicujus, was capable
of usucapion in spite of the acquirer’s knowledge of existing owner-
ship. Gaius, therefore, takes no notice of usucapion against heres
voluntarius, and only quotes the usucapion against the enfranehised
slave.

The only successor who was not liable to be thus plundeffld was
the suus heres. Nihil pro herede posse usucapi, suis heredibus ex-
istentibus, magis obtinuit, Cod. 7, 29, 2. ⁶ 'rhat no stranger can
acquire as quasi-heir by usucapion against a sslf-successor, is an
established rule of law.’
