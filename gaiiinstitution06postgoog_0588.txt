. corresponding to the second stipulation in the Sacramentum and

SponsiO.

In a judicium Cascellianum for recovering possession, ᾧ 166, and
fructus, ᾧ 167, or a Sponsio based on the interdicte Uti possidetis
and Utrubi fuit, both parties being originally both plaintiff and
defendant, there were (A) two sponsiones and two restipulatioues for a
penal sum3 there was no security (B) corresponding to the security
Pro praede litis et vindiciarum3 but (C) a fructuaria Stipulatio,
ᾗ 166, for a penal sum equal to' the value of the mesne profits; or,
as an alternative, a Satisdatio judicatum solvi, ᾧ 169, contemplating
an action (judicium fructuarium) based 011 the Licitatio or auction
of the fruits.

Belonging, apparently, to the formalities of Sponsio was a pro-

oeeding which has caused commentators on Roman law no little ·

embarrassment—Deductio quae moribus fit, It is mentioned in
connection with litigation respect-ing land by Cicero, Pro Tullio
and Pro Caecina, and in the latter oration is called Vis ex conventu.
We therefore may venture to identify Deductio with the Vis
mentioned by Gaius, ᾧ 170, as forming part of the process in Uti
possidetis and other prohibitor-y interdicte. In real action whether
by Sponsio or by Vindicatio (formula petitoria) it would be ne-
cessary, if the fact of possession was 001110οω11, 130 determine who
should have the interim possession, and this point would 110 110·
cided by means of a preliminary Sponsio based on Uti possidetis.
Interim possession would be awarded to the party who had actual
possession, and the fact of actual possession would 110 tried
on an action (Sponsio) brought on a preconcerted trespass
(vis ex conventu). The following would 110 the successive
stages of procedure. An interdict Uti possidetis would be ob-
tained from the praetor: a fictitious ejectment (Deductio, Vis ex
conventu) would take place by arrangement between the parties:
a Sponsio would be made to ascertain which of the parties had
herein contravened the interdict3 and according to the issue of this
Sponsio one of the parties would be put into interim possession:
finally the judex would have to adjudicate, either on a formula peti-
toria or on another Sponsio involving the question of ownership.
§98. We have an allusion to the security of a procurator
plaintiff in the BrutuS, where the negotiorum gestor is called
voluntarius procurator. Mihi quoque, inquit Brutus, expectanda
sunt ea quae Attico polliceris, etsi fortasse ego a te hujus volun-
