DE OBLIGATIONIBUS.

Quod ad fidejussiones et mutui dationes pro aliis pro quibus inter-
cesserint feminae pertinet, tametsi ante videtur ita jus dictum esse,
ne eo nomine ab his petitio neve in eas actio detur, quum eas
virilibus officiis fungi et ejus generis obligationibus obstringi non
sit aequum: arbitrari senatum, recte atque ordine facturos ad quos
de ea re in jure aditum erit, si dederint operam ut in ea re senatus
voluntas servetur, Dig. 16, l, 2. ‘ On the question of the consuls
Marcus Silanus and Velleius Tutor, how the liabilities of women
who undertake to be responsible for the debts of others should be
dealt with by the tribunals, it was resolved that guar-antiss and
interventions of women (loans to women instead of to others whose
liabilities are thus assumed by women), though formerly held to be
valid‚ shall not henceforth be valid to support any actions or suits
against female interessem-s, as manly functions and liabilities are
not fairl’y chargeable on women, [and] the senate deem it incum-
bent on the judicature to see that their will in this matter is
enforced.’ Imnvnnmon, as was explained above, is a form of
Privative Intercession3 whereby a woman does not, like an Ex-
promissor‚ discharge a pre-existing obligation, but incurs an ori-
ginal obligation which would otherwise have been incumbent on
another person. Cod. 4, 29, 4, ibid. 19.

'Phough the senatusconsultum seems to say that no action shall
be brought against a female guarantor‚ yet the frequent occurrence
of the phrase, exceptio senatusconsulti Velleiani, shows that an
action might be brought, but was barrable by an exception pleading
the senatusconsult.

Transcriptive entries are of two
kinds, either from thing to person
or from person to person.

§ 129. Transcription from thing
to person is exemplified when the

tract of sale or lettiug or partner-
