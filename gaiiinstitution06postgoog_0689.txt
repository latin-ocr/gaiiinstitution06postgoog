SIMULATIVE DISPOSITIONS. 667

The degree of integrity or mutilation in which the primeval
disposition persisted in the modern institution varied in different
instances. Sometimes the old proceeding imposed all its rules on
the new institution: more commonly many of its aspects were
effaced and only isolated incidente continued in force. The pro-
cedure which involved Coemptio, 1 ᾗ 113, was applied by the in-
genuity of later jurists to accomplish three purposes never dreamed
of by those who presided over its introduction: the extinction of
the sacred rites by which the estate of an heiress was burdened 3
the change of guardian by a woman at the period when all women
were under wardship 3 and the acquisition of testamentary capacity
by a woman at a time when widowhood was the only title by
which it could be acquired. It was a complicated process and
consisted of three factore, each of which was an archaic institution ε
(1) a Hand-marriage (in manum conventio) accompanied with a
fiducia for remancipation3 (2) a remancipation accompanied with
a fiducia for manumission ς (3) a manumission and consequent
wardship. Of these factors the Hand-marriage was a pure un-
reality: it was divested of reality by the accompanying fiducia 3
yet one os its incidents continued in force, the transfer of the
obligation to the sacred rites from the heiress to the coemptionator.
The second act was so far an unreality that it was no longer the
sale of a wife by her savage lord in exchange for some more coveted
commodity: but it was real so far as it subjected the remancipated
woman to capitis minutio. The manumission was unreal so far as
it implied a. vindication into freedom or a liberalis causa and an
escape from the hardships of bondage: but it was real so far as it
had the effect of making the manumitted ex-bondwoman the ward
of her manumitter.

Emancipation was another ceremony which employed a primitive
disposition divested of its natural motive. 'Phe independence of
the son whose father had three times sold or leased his patria
potestas over him to a stranger was originally enacted by the
Twelve Tables as a punishment for an odious and uunatural ex-
ercise of parental rights. In later times the mancipation of the
son for the sake of its legal consequences was an act of sels-abnega-
tion on the part· of the father; a. means of promoting the son to
an independent position, the status of head of a household.

The positive and arbitrary character of SIMULA'nvz dispositione
