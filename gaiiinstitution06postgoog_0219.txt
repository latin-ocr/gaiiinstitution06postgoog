QUIBUS ALIEN ΑΒΕ LIOEAT. 19⁷

closely allied modes (for instance, the necessarius heres acquires
without aditio, which is a parcel of the title of voluntarius heres),
or for some other reason, divers modes are lumped together under
the head of acquisition by lex. The name, however, besides being
a misnomer, is merely a sink or receptacle of miscellaneous un·
related titlae, just as we shall find in the doctrine of obligations
that miscellaneous titles (variae causarum figurae) are lumped
together under the denomination of quasi-contract.

QUIBUS A‘LIENARE mcm'r vnn non.

ξ 62. Accidit aliquand0‚ ut qui
dominus sit alienandae rei potesta·
tem non habeat, et qui dominus non
sit alienare possit.

ξ 63. Nam dotale praedium ma-
ritus invita muliere per legem Iuliam
prohibetur alienare, quamvis ipsius
sit vel mancipatum ei dotis causa
vel in iure cessum vel usucaptum.
quod quidem ius utrum ad Italica
tantum praedia, an etiam ad pro—
vincialia pertineat, dubitatur.

§ 64. Ex diverso agnatus furiosi
curator rem furiosi alienare potest
ex lege ΧΠ tabularum ; item pro-
curator, id est σπη’ libera adminis-
tratio permissa est ‚· item creditor
pignus ex pactione, quamvis eius ea
res non sit. sed hoc forsitan ideo
videatur fieri, quod voluntate debi-
toris intellegitur pignus alienari, qui
olim pactus est, ut liceret creditori
pignus vendere, si pecunia non sol·
vatur.

ᾗ 62. It sometimes occurs that a
proprietor has not a power of alien—
ation, and that a non-proprietor has
a power ol* alienation.

ξ 63. The alienation of dower
land by the husband, without the
consent of the wife, is prohibited by
the lex J ulia, although the husband
is proprietor of the land by its man·
cipation as dower‚ or by surrender
before a magistrate, or by usucapion.
Whether this disability is conlined
to Italian soil, or extends to the
provinces, authorities differ.

ξ 64. Contrariwise‚ an agnate, as
a lunatic's committee, is empowered
to aliene his property by the law of
the Twelve Tables} and so is an
agent, when invested by his prin-
cipal with free power of administra-
tion (Inst. 2, 1, 43). Again‚ a
pledgee, in pursuance of his conven-
tion, may aliene the pledge, though
not proprietor3 this, however, may
be said to rest on the assent of the
pledgor previously given in the con-

tract of pledge, which empowered
the pledgee to sell in default of

payment.

§§ 62-64. It is conjectured that by some accidental displacement
these three paragraphs have been transposed, and that in their
proper order they should follow § '7 9 and precede ᾧ 80. There
seems no good reason why they should be interposed between the
titles of civil law and the titles of natural law.
