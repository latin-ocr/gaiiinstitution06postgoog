Private law (jus privatum) as opposed to her Public law (jus pub-
licum) in both acceptatione, in other words, as opposed both to her
Criminal law and to her Constitutional law.

A scientific jurisprudence and a well-arranged code would imitate

to the particular, from the general to the special: that is, before
expounding the special branches of law, would enunciate the ideas
and principles common to all the branches. The advantage gained
by this arrangement would be simplification and the avoidance of

repetition. Thus Biology expounds the general doctrines of ana-
tomy and physiology before it treats in detail of the separate classes
of vegetables or animals3 and the best German j urists follow a
similar method in their Pandects or systematic expositions of
Roman law. Gaius, however, in his Institutione, thinking, per-

abstract, omits the general or transcendental basis of jurisprudence
and plunges at once into the special divisione of the code. A com-
