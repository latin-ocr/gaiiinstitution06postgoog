allies in the direct line, or their ascendente or descendente, was
absolutely prohibited3 collater-al alliance was no impediment in the
time of Gaius, but at a later period marriage with a deceased

· To the marriage of a filius- οι· filia-familias the consent of the
father was required: but if he withheld it without a reason he could
be compelled by the magistrate to give it, and, in the case of a
daughter, to provide a dower, D. 23, 2, 19: one of several in-
stances in which, as the condition of the validity of a title, when
a voluntary action could not be obtained, the legislator substituted
a compulsor-y action, instead of simply declaring the action unneces-

ξ 65. It sometimes happens that
children when first born are not in
their father' s power, but are subse-
quently brought into subjection to
him.

ξ 66. Thus, under the lex Aelia
Sentia a Latin who marries and
begets a son of Latin status by a
Latin mother, or a citizen of Rome
by a Roman mother, is not invested

with power over him, but on proof ⁸< * . 1
of his above· mentioned statutory ψει»
title, he becomes a citizen of Rome w‘- ·

in a mistaken belief that she is a
citizen of Rome, the son whom he
begets is not in his power, not being
born a citizen of Rome, but a Latin
or an alien, that is 10 say, of the
same status as his mother, for a
child is not born into the condition
