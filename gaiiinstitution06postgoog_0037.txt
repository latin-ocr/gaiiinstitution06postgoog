PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS. 15

2, 9. ‘To know or be aware has two meanings, to have knowledge
and to use knowledge ‚- so that a man who has knowledge and does
not use it may be J ustly said in one sense not to know, in another
sense to know, if he fails to use it from negligence. . . . This dis-
tinction, then, must be added to complete the definition of the
voluntary! The Intentional, then, might be defined to be, that
which is desired and caused with an explicit knowledge that it would
be caused, or, with an explicit knowledge of its component elements.

Intention (dolus) is either hasty, intention (exemplified in ἀδίκημα),
including actions impelled by any appetite or emotion, or deliberate
intention (exemplified in ἀδικία), denominated Resolve or Resolution
(προαίρεσις). προαιρετὸν τὸ ἑκούσιον τὸ προβεβουλευμένον, Ethica
Nic. 3, 2, 17. ‘That is resolved which is voluntary and premedi-
tated! ἡ προαίρεσις ἂν εἴη βουλευτικῆ ὄρεξις, ibid. 3, 3, 19. ‘ Reso-
lution is deliberate volition.’ ·

Negligent violation of the law (culpa, ἁμάρτημα) is distinguished,
on the one side, from misadventure (casus, ἀτύχημα), and, on the
other, from intentional violation of the law (dolus, ἀδίκημα), which
again is distinguished from deliberate violation of the law (ἀδικία).
τριῶν δὴ οὐσῶν βλαβῶν τῶν ἐν ταῖς κοινωνίαις, τὰ μὲν μετ’ ἀγνοίας
ἁμαρτήματά ἔστιν, ὅταν μήτε ὅν, μήτε ὡς, μήτε ᾦ, μήτε οὗ ἕνεκα ὑπέλαβε,
ταῦτα πράξῃ . . . ὅταν μὴ παραλόγως ἡ βλαβῆ γένηται . . . ὅταν δὲ εἰδὼς
μὲν μὴ προβουλεύσας δέ, ἀδίκημα . . . ὅταν δ’ ἐκ προαιρέσεως, ἄδικος καὶ
μοχθηρός, ibid. 5, 8. ‘ Of the three gradatione of misconduct
towards othere, Fault or Negligence (culpa) is an unlawful act in
ignorance of the subject, the degree, the instrument, the con-
sequences, when it was reasonable to expect the mischief3 unlawful
intention (dolus) is breach of law with knowledge of these elements,
but without premeditation3 malice or depravity is evineed by the
resolution or deliberate intention of violating law?

'l'he distinction between Negligence and Intention, and between
hasty and deliberate intention, is not so important in the civil code
as in the criminal code and in the eye of the moralist. 'Phe criminal
code punishes less severely wrongs of inadvertence and criines com-
mitted under provocation. But the thougbtless, incautious, im-
prudent, author of unlawful mischief, although he intended no
harm, is just as accountable‚ chargeable, liable to the sanction of
the civil law, and compellable to make reparation, as if his infrac-

tion of law was intentional.
