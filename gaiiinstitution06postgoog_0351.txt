§57. Unde evenit, ut multum
differant ea iura quae in bonis Isa-
tinorum ex lege Iunia constituta
sunt, ab his quae in hereditate
civium Romanorum libertorum ob-
servantur.

§ 58. Nam civis Romani liberti
hereditas ad extraneos heredes pa·
troni nullo modo pertinet : ad filium
autem patroni nepotesque ex filio et
pronepotes ex nepote filio nato
proynatos omnimodo pertinet, eti-
amsi a parente fuerint exheredati:
Latinorum autem bona tamquam
peculia servorum etiam ad extra-
neos heredes pertinent, et ad liberos
manumissoris exheredatos non per·
tinent.

ᾧ 59. Item civis Romani liberti
hereditas ad duos pluresve patronos
aequaliter pertinet, licet dispar in
eo servo dominium habuerint: bona
vero Latinorum pro ea parte per-
tinent pro qua parte quisque eorum
dominus fuerit.

ξ 60. Item in hereditate civis
Romani liberti patronus alterius
patroni filium excludit, et filius
patroni alterius patroni nepotem
repellit: bona autem Latinorum et
ad ipsum patronum et ad alterius
patroni heredem simul pertinent
pro qua parte ad ipsum manumis-
sorem pertinerent.

ξ 61. Item si unius patroni tres
forte liberi sunt, et alterius unus,
hereditas civis Romani liberti in
capita dividitur, id est tres fratres
tres portiones ferunt et unus quar-
tam: bona vero Latinorum pro ea
parte ad successores pertinent pro
qua parte ad ipsum manumissorem
pertinerent.

LIBERTI LATINI.

ξ 57. Accordingly there are wide
differences between the title to the
goods of Latini Juniani under the
lex J unia and the title to the suc-
cessione of freedmen possessed of
the plenary franchise.

ᾧ 58. When a freedman pos·
sessed of the full franchise dies, an
external heir of the patron has no
claim on his successim, while a son
of the patron, a grandson by a son
a great-grandson by a grandson by
a son, have an indefessible claim
even after disinheritance3 whereas,
when a Latinus J unianus dies, his
goods are transmitted to his patron's
external heir, and the claim of the
patron’s children is barred by dis-
inheritance.

ξ 59. Α freedman with the ple·
nary franchise leaves several patrous
his cosuccessors in equal porticus,
in however unequal proportione they
had been his proprietors; whereas
the goods of a Latinus J unianus
belong to his patrous in the ratio
of the property which they had in
him when he was a slave.

ξ 60. In the succession to a freed-
man who had the plenary franchise,
one patron bars another patron's
son, and a son of one patron bars
another patron’s grandson3 whereas
the goods of a Latinus J unianus
belong to a patron and another pa-
tron's heir in the same proportione
in which they would have belonged
to the two patrons.

§eL If one patron leave three
sons, and another patron one, the
succession of a freedman who had
the plenary franchise is divided by
the number of individuals3 that is
to say, every one takes an equal
portion; whereas the goods of a
Latinus J unianus belong to the sons
of the patrous, not in their own
right, but in right of representation 3
that is to say, in the proportion in
which they would have belonged to
the original manumitters. -
