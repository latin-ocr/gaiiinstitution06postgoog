called Fraud (fraus); it is ground to support an actio doli and
in integrum restitutio on account of dolus.

Malice in English law appears to denote deliberate intention,
or rather the depravity of disposition or badness of heart (ἀδικία)
which is assumed to be evidenced by a deliberate unlawful intention.
Such at least is its meaning in the definition of murder. Perhap3‚
however, it sometimes only denotes unlawful intention (ἀδίκημα),
and, as rather belonging to the criminal than the civil code, it may
be regarded as equivalent to crimina] intention.

In the foregoing analysis of Intention, we have chiefly considered
it as an ingl-edient in Torts and Crimes. As entering into Dis-
position, Intention has essentially the same character: that is to
say, we must distinguish two stages in an act of will: an imper-
fect stage which may be called Volition, or an act of will unac-
companied by knowledge of certain facts3 and a perfect stage
which may be called Intention, or an act of will when accompanied
and extended by such information. There is only this difference,
that Offenees are physical actions, and the Volition and Intention
involved in them relate exclusively to muscular movements and
their immediate consequences: in the analysis of Disposition we
must substitute for Austin’s statement the broader statement of
Aristotle, and consider that the Volition and Intention which
belong to the essence of Disposition relate, not, like those which
enter into torts and crimes, to a muscular act and the result which
it produces, but to an external declaration (incorporation) of an
intended disposition, and either to (A) the whole disposition or to
(B) certain of the essential elements of the disposition. This may
be illustrated by example&

A. Of dispositions null and void (wanting the essence of true
dispositione) because Intention is excluded by error relating to
the whole disposition we have an instance when a man signs one
document believing it to be another.

B. The essential elements in respect of which an error excludes
Intention and avoids the disposition are (1) the Right to be created
by a disposition, (2) the Person to be invested with a right by a
disposition, (3) the Thing to be transferred by a disposition.

1. There is an error in the Right to be created when a promissor
means a loan and the acceptor means a donation, or vice versa.

2. There is an error as to the Person who is the object of a dis-
position: in a devise, if the testator names one person as devisee
