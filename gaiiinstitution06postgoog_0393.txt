116611 reimbursed or discharged.'] If the moneys on each day that
they fall due are not paid to the mortgagee or his heir, 111611 1116
above named land and slaves, or such of the said slaves as the
mortgagee or his heir shall elect, at the place where and at the
time when he pleaseS, may be sold by the mortgagee or his heir
for ready money (i.e. for a less price than might be obtained by a
sale on credit); and the mortgagee 01· his heir shall not be com-
pelled to mancipate them for more 111611 6 single sesterce (i.e. if,
as mancipable things, he aliene them by mancipation, it shall be
merely a formal mancipation‚ not one that would subject him to
auctoritas, i.e. liability in case of eviction as wari-antor of the title
(ᾗ 141, 60111.) 10 1116 vendee); and shall not in pursuance of the 111611-
cipation give to the vendee assurance with sureties for the title3 nor
without sureties (ᾧ 127, 60111.) covenant with the vendes for single
or double compensation in the event of eviction in the terms in
which a mancipator gives assurance with sureties (i. e. the mort-
gagee shall not be bound to make himself 1161116 as warrantor of
the title (auctor) to 1116 vendee, either by implication of law or by
express covenant, and that either with or without sureties).'

We may assume that further articles bound the mortgagee, on
satisfaction of the mortgage debt8‚ to restore the land and slaves
to the mortgagor.

(2) Pignus was effected by delivery of possession without the
solemnities of mancipatio, 'Phe mortgagor continued to be pro-
prietor of the thing pledged. Pignus, manente proprietate debi-
toris, solam possessionem transfert ad creditorem, Dig. 13, 7, 5, 1.
Qui pignori dedit, ad usucapionem tantum possidet3 quod ad reli-
quas omnes causas pertinet, qui accepit possidet, Dig. 41, 3, 16.
‘ The mortgagor only possesses for usucapion, for all other intents
and purposes the mortgagee has possession.'

(3) Hypothecation was effected by mere convention without deli-
very of possession. It was a pure Alienation of a jus in re, imposing
no Obligation. Pignus combined this with Obligations of the
mortgagee, conferring a Personal aetion on the mortgagor.

The action of the mortgagee to recover the thing pledged, called
quasi Serviana, hypothecaria, or pignoraticia contraria, was a real
action 01 vindicatiO. It was probably an actio arbitraria with a
formula in factum concepta (these terms will be explained in Book
IV) to something like the following effect: ‘ If it be proved that
such and such land was mortgaged by the defendant to the plaintiff
