the legislator having thought it sufli-

chapter.

ξ 210. The lex Aquilia was a plebiscito carried by a tribune called
Aquilius, according to Theophilus, at one of the secessione of the
plebs, probably at the secession to the J aniculam, B.c. 285, on
which same occasion the lex Hortensia was carried, making the
plebiscites binding on the patriciana.

The words of the first clause are preserved in the Digest: Qui
servum servamve alienum alienamve, quadrupedemve pecude'm
injuria occiderit, quanti id in eo anno plurimi fuit, tantum aes dare
domino damnas estc, Dig. 9, 2, 2. ‘ If a slave, male or female,
of another person, or a quadruped of his cattle is unlawfully slain,
whatever was the highest value it bore in the previous year, such
sum shall be due as a judgment debt from the slayer to the owner.'
Cattle are animale that feed in flocks or herds, and include horses,
ο mules, asses, oxen, sheep, goats, and swine, 4 § 171.

condemnatio or last part of a formula when a defendant is bound to

words have two meanings: they mean either (1) the value of

a thing to the world in general, i. e. its seHing value or market
value, called verum rei pretium, or vera rei aestimati03 or (2) its
