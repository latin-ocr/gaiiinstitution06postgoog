a single issue of fact3 for thus he tacitly introduced a new major '¹
premiss, B is A, or conver-ted a rule of equity or public opinion into- 1
a principle of substantive law, without any fiction or reference to
previous rules.

(2) When he granted a fictitious action, that is, one whose
intentio in jus concepta, of the form, Si paret . . . . oportere,
admitted issues both of fact and of law, the fiction furnished an
exact measure of the extent to which the old law had been
abandoned. If the old law is represented by the major premiss,
B is A, the praetor might suppress some clement, X, of the title
B to which the remedy A was annexed3 and make the conclusion,
C is A, follow from the minor premiss, C is B minus X. The
fiction would be the false assumption that C (the plaintiff’s case)
satisfied the abrogated condition X whenever it was proved to
satissy the remaining clement-s of B. By ruling that the fictitious Ι
proposition, C is X, should not be called in question, and that the Ι
defendant should not be allowed to demur to the plaintiff's claim
on the ground that X was unsatisfi'ed, the praetor would virtually
abrogate the old law, B is A, and substitute for it the new law, B
minus X is A. In the cases given by Gaius the condition repre-
sented by X relates to succession, usucapio, citizenship, status. It
might relate to delivery, contract, alienation, or any other dispo-
sition. In the actio Pauliana, protecting creditors against
fraudulent alienations, the fiction was an assumption of non· delivery
(rescissa traditione). Restitutio in integrum of a minor or person
who had acted under constraint of fear might assume the form of a
fictitious action which treated the rescinded act as anper-formed
(rescissa alienatione).

ς 35. 'Phe purchaser of a bankrupt's estate, unlike the purchaser
at a sectio bonorum, or sale sub hasta of the confiscated goods of a
criminal, though a universal successor, only took, in the lanqu’e
of English law, the equitable and not the legal estate. To protect
his rights the praetor allowed him to sue in the character of heres,
or successor to the legal estate.

'Phe praetor Publius Rutilius may either have been a person who
was praetor in 16⁷ 13.0., or a person who was consul in 104 Β.ο.
The formula which he introduced was used by the cognitor and
procurator, 4 ᾗ 86. Before his time, apparently, the lawyers enter·
tained a superstition about a variance between the intentio and
condemnatio,
