Real actions before the Centumviral Court: caefi-5250 would bc the
appropriate Personal action for recovering a certain sum or thing
due upon a unilateral contract, real (mutuum), verbal (stipulatio), or
literal (expensilatio); and J udjgis postulatio the appropriate Personal
action for recovering an uncertain sum due on a bilateral contract,
and enforcing obligations to perform (facere) rather than to convey.

'Phe gist (gite) of the civil aetion of CondictiO, i.e. the circum-
stance whereon it lay, the title or ground of aetion, was the increase
of the defendant's fortune or patrimony by the reduction of the
plaintiff‘s patrimony without any consideration or equivalent gain
to the pla-intiff. This disturbance the law restored. 'Phe simplest,
and probably the earliest, instance of the principle was mutui datio.
Here the defendant's wealth is increased and that of the plaintiff
diminished by a voluntary act of the plaintiff ; but the principle
equally covers cases where the relation is not knowingly and
intentionally initiated by the plaintiff, e. g. payment by mis-take
(solutio indebiti) and failure of consideration (eausa data, causa
non secuta). From mutui datio, or actual loan, the Condietion
was extended to Expensilatio and Stipulatio, both of which, pro·
bably‚ were imaginary loanS, that is, pacts solemnized and fortified
by the fiction of a loan. We are expressly informed that this was
the case with Expensilatio, 2 ᾧ 129, and from etymology (st-ips:
pecunia) and the analogy of Nexum (a fictitious weighing out of
bars of bronze), we may conjecture the same of Stipulatio.

The introduction of actions stricti juris is probably of more

 

Ι ancient date than the introduction of actions based on bon-a fidem

the necessity, that is, of applying the power of the State to
enforee the class of obligations pursued by Condictio was earlier
felt than the necessity of compelling men to perform their so-called
obligations ex fide bona. From the antithesis of strictum jns and
bona fides it might be imagined that trust, confidence, credit, re-
lianee on good saith, were entirely foreign to civil obligationS‚ and
were only ingredients in equitable obligations, This is the reverse
of the truth. Greater confidence (fides) is involved in mutui datie,
greater risk is incurred by the obligee, who starts by alienating his
property and making it the property of the obligor, who denudes
himself, that is, of the remedy of vin(lieati0‚ than in any other
contracta, most of which leave the promisee, even before the inven-
tion of personal actionS, armed, if need be, with the legal remedy
of vindicatio. Other contracts we can imagine left to the protec-
