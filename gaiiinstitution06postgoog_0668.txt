by the conjunction of a corporeal and a mental act, and not by
either separately.' Neratius et Proculus solo animo non posse nos
adquirere possessionem aiunt, si non antecedat naturalis possessio,
Ibid. 3. ‘ Intention alone does not suffice for acquiring possession
unless preceded by detention.' Detention necessarily implies not
corporeal contact, but corporeal presence [except when a movable
is by my order placed in my house during my absence]‚ and is the
physical power of dealing immediately with a subject and excludjng
any foreign agency. 'I'he acquisition of detention is Prehensiom
which is never fictitious or symbolical, but a real physical change of
relation. The continuance of possession requires a continuance of
both the clemente which are essential to its acquisitiom that is,
both physical control and the intention of enjoying as proprietor.
Fere quibuscunque modis obligamur iisdem in contrarium actis
liberamur, quum quibus modis acquirimus, iisdem in contrarium
actis amittimus. Ut igitur nulla possessio acquiri nisi animo et
corpore potest, ita nulla amittitur nisi in qua utrumque (utrumque
=alterutrum, or read utcunque or utrumcunque) in contrarium
actum est, Dig. 50, 17, 153. ‘As obligation is dissolved by a
reversal of the conditions under which it is created, so possession is
lost by a reversal of the conditions under which it is acquired. As
its acquisition demands the concurrence of a corporeal and a mental
condition, so its termination requires the reversal of one or the
other.' Ejus quidem quod corpore nostro teneremus [dicam]
possessionem amitti vel animo vel etiam corpore, Dig. 41, 2, 44
‘ When we detain in person, possession may be terminated by either
a mental or a physical change!

The physical condition, however, is not to be interpreted so
strictly in the continuance of possession as in its commencement ;
for continued possession permits a temporary suspension of physica]
control, and only requires the power of reproducing this relation
at will: sor instance, it is not lost if we have left a thing
unintentionally in a forest, but remember the exact spot3 or have
stowed a thing in a place of security, but forget for the moment
where we put it; or abandon an Alpine pasture in winter, with the
intention of revisiting it on the return of summer. Nerva filius res
mobiles, excepto homine, quatenus sub custodia nostra sint, hac-
tenus possideri, id est, quatenus, si velimus, naturalem possessionem
nancisci possimus, Dig. 41, 2, 3, 13. ‘ The possession( of movables,
excepting slaves, is terminated by loss of custody, or¹ the power of
