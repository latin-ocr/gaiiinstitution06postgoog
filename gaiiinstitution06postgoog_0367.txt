debt, he shall be delivered into the hande of the creditor, to be
forcibly removed and confined in stocke or fettere. . . . During a
subsequent interval the debtor might effect a compromiee, but in
default of a compromise was detained in chaine for sixty days.
During this period, on three continuone ninth or market-days he
was taken before the praetor in the comitium, where the amount of
the judgment debt was proclaimed. On the third multet-day he
was put to death, or sold into slavery beyond the Tiber. . . . On
the third market-day, say the Twelve Tables, the creditore may cut
their portione of his body, and no creditor who cute too little or
too much shall be therefore called to account.’

In close imitation of this execution against the body, a process
of execution against the property of an ineolvent was introduced [Ρ]
by a praetor named Publius Rutilius, upwards of a century before
the Christian era. It ie from an assumption of the paralleliem
of these proceedinge that we conjecture that in missio in posses-
sionem an interval of two months was required to elapee between
the first eeizure and the ultimate eale (addictio) of the ineolvent’e
estate. We may notice that the magisterial award (addictio) of the
ineolvent’s body took place, according to Gellius, at the commence-
ment of the eixty days of his detention3 whereas the transfer (addictio)
of the ineolvent’s estate to the vendee takes place at the end of sixty
days from the original eeizure. In confirmation of the opinion that
the period of sixty days was observed in both forme of execution (cor-
poreal and proprietary) against the ineolvent, we may remember that
in ordinary execution (pignoris capio), as above mentioned, a period
of eixty days elapeed between the eeizure and eale of the distreee.

Some of the details of the proceedinge in a missio in possessionem
which are omitted by Gaius may be supplied from Theophilus.
Before the final transfer of the debtor’e estate (addictio) three
decreee of the praetor were necessary ε·-

(1) A decree authorizing the seizure of the debtor'e estate and ite
advertieement for sale (proscriptio). Theophilus gives the form of
