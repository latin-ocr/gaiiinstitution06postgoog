nistrator. In Legis actio the Legislator and the Litigants seem
alone to occupy the scene. The Praetor is only present as master
of the ceremonies, and even as such can only utter sentences which
the Legislator has previously dictated. In the Formulary system
the Praetor appears with much larger attributione ς’ he seems to ·
have stepped in front of the Legislator and has taken much of the
initiative from the SnitorS. Thus, marking the respective promi-
nence of the STATUTB and the mmmsrnuon, we might denominate
the older and younger systems as Legis actio and Praetoris inter-
positio : and it is this accentuation of the statute-book or lawgiver
as opposed to the tribunals or executive that the translation has
attempted to express in offering the invented term Statute-process
as a version of Legis actio·

(2) Both statute-process and the Formula, as representing at
'different periods the Ordo judiciorum or ordinary course of pro·
cedure, exemplify the predominance of the lawgiver as contrasted
with that of the magistrate, when opposed to extraordinary pro-
cedure or Cognitio extraordinaria praetoris. The latter was the
appropriate procedure in plaints of children against their parents
or slaves against their owners‚ victims to whom the civil law ac-
corded no rights: or in grievous damnification (laesio) occasioned
by some exceptional condition (justa causa)—fraud, violence, ab·
sence, ignorance, minority (p. 152)-—so exceptional that it had been
overlooked or disregarded in the rules of jus strictum respecting
dispositione and the modes of acquiring dominion. In these and
other cases, e. g. claims of honorarium (p. 432) for liberal services,
which in infant society had been gratuitous or only recompensed by
political power: claims under testamentary trusts which had not
been recognized when the rules regarding testamentary disposi-
tions were crystallizing: the praetor by his inquisition and decree
(p. 572) superseded not only the judex but also the lawgiver, who
had uttered no commands respecting the various circumstances
above enumerated. Respecting trusts compare the statement of
