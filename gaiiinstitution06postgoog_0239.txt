et hoc dicitur nuncupatio, nuncu-
pare est enim palam nominare ; et
sane quae testator specialiter in
tabulis testamenti scripserit, ea
videtur generali sermone nominare

. atque confirmare.

§105. In testibus autem non
debet is esse qui in potestate est
aut familiae emptoris aut ipsius
testatoris, quia propter veteris iuris
imitationem totum hoc negotium
quod agitur testamenti ordinandi
gratia creditur inter familiae emp·
torem agi et testatorem: quippe
olim, ut proxime diximus, is qui
familiam testatoris mancipio acci-
piebat, heredis loco erat. itaque
reprobatum est in ea re domesticum
testimonium.

ξ 106. Unde et si is qui iu potes-
tate patris est familiae emptor ad-
hibitus sit, pater eius testis esse
non potest: at ne is quidem qui m
eadem potestate est, velut frater
eius. Sed si filiusfamilias ex oas-
trensi peculio post missionem faciat
testamentum, nec pater eius recte
testis adhibetur, nec is qui in potes-
tate patris sit.

receive, and, in order to validate
thy will conformably to Roman
law, with this ingot, and ‘—as
some continue-22⁴ with this scale of
bronze, unto me be it purchased!
Then with the ingot he strikes the
scale, and delivers the ingot to the
testator, as by way of purchase-
money. Thereupon the testator,
holding the tablets of his will, says
as follows: ‘This estate, as in
these tablets and iu this wax is
written, I so grant, so devise, so
dispose3 and do you, Quirites, so
give me your attestation.' These
words are called the nuncupation,
for nuncupation signifies public
declaration, and by these general
words the specific written disposi-
tions of the testator are published
and confirmed.

ξ 105. For the part of witness, it
is a disqualification to be in the
power of the fictitious vendee or of
the testator, because, the old pro·
ceeding furnishing the model, the
whole testamentary process is sup-
posed to be a transaction between
the vendee and the testator; and
in old timeS, as was just observed,
the vendee was the testamentary
successor3 wherefore no person in
the power of the vendee was a oom-
petent witness.

§106. Hence, if the vendec is
a filiusfamilias, neither his father
nor any one in his father's power,
his brother, for instance, is com-
petent to attest; and if a filius-
familiaS, after his discharge from
service, make a will of his military
peculium, neither his father nor any
one in his father’s power is qualified
to be a witness.

ξ 107. The same rules apply to
the balance-holder, for the balance-
holder is a witness.

is in the power of the heir or
