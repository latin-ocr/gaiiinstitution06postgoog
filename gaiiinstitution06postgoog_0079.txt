1. §5 28-35.] Q. M. LATINI AD OIVITATEM R. P. 57

ᾧ 29. The decision (sententia) of the judex in a judicium ordi-
narium was either condemnatio or absolutio of the defendant. In
real actions this was apparently preceded by pronuntiatio, a declara·-
ffion of the rights of the parties. This appears from the following,
among other passages: Sed et si fundum vindicem meum esse,
tuque confessus sis, perinde teneberis atque si dominii mei fundum
esse pronunciatum esset, Dig. 42, 2, 6, 2. Si quum de hereditate inter
me et te controversia esset, juravero hereditatem meam esse, id con-
sequi debeo quod haberem si secundum me de hereditate pronun-
tiatum esset, Dig. 12, 2, 10, 3. When the pronuntiatio was for
the plaintiff, if the defendant obeyed the arbitrium or provisional
order of the judex ΒΥ making restitution‚ there was no subsequent
condemnatio. In the form of real action, called a praejudicium,
that is, a simple issue of fact, the pronunciatio formed the whole
result of the trial, and was not followed by sententia. Similarly,
when a Latinus laid his claim of Roman franchise before the
praetor under this enactment of the lex Aelia sentia, the result
of the extraordinaria cognitio of the praetor, as appears by this
paragraph, was merely a pronuntiatio without any subsequent
decretum.

§352 Besides the method provided by the lex Aelia Sentis,
Latinus or Latina might attain the Roman franchise under the
following conditione :—

1. By erroris causae probati0, i.‘e. if, intending to comply with
the statute, Latinus marry Peregrina, believing her to be Latina,
§703 or Latina marry Peregrinus, believing him to be Latinus,
ξ 693 or if Civis, believing himself to be Latinus, marry Latina,
ᾧ 71; or if Civis marry Latina, believing her to be Civis Romana,
§673 on proof of this mistake‚ the Latinus or Latina and their
offspring acquire the franchise.

2. By magistracy in a Latin colony Latinus becomes Civis Ro-
manus, § 95.

3. By remanumission (iteratio), i. e. aster aequit-ing Latinity by
one of the private modes of manumission, a subsequent manumission
by one of the public modes, vindicta, censu, or testamentO, eonverted
Latinus into Civis, ᾧ 35, and Ulpian, 3, 4.

4. By six years' service in the Roman guards (si inter vigiles
Romae sex annos militaverit, Ulp. 3, 5). A decree of the senate
made three years' service a sufficient title. Compare the provision
of 13 Geo, II, c. 3, whereby every foreign seaman who in time of
