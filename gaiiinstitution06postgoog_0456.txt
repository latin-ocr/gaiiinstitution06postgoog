434 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [111. ἕξ 155-162.

treats of a miscellaneous group of obligations which are neither
founded on contraot nor on delict, and which, as the circumstances
in which they arise resemble more or less the circumstances of one
or other of the legal conventionS, are denominated by the name of
obligations quasi ex contractu. These demand from us a brief
notice.

Three of them, namely, those which ground the actions ΒΥ or
against a tutor, ΒΥ οι· against a curator, by or against an unau-
thorized agent (negotiorum gestor), clearly resemble obligations
founded on the conti-act of mandate. The ward and minor stand
to the tutor and curator nearly in the relation of principal and
agent, although they are legally incompetent to give an authority
(mandatum) or confer a power of administration. A person wh0,
in the absence and without the knowledge of another, officiously
interfered to protect his interest-s (voluntarius procurator) incurred
liability and aequired rights against the person in whose affairs he
interfered. English law does not recognize a title to compensation
in the case of officious interference‚ unless we find a parallel in the
rights of salvor-s in the case of property lost or endangered on the
ocean.

Three other obligations quasi ex contractu, those that are en-
forced by an action for division of common property between tenants
in common (communi dividundo), by action for partition of an in·
heritance between co·successors (familiae erciscundae), by an action
for demarcation of boundaries between adjoining landowners (fini-
um regundorum), resemble the obligations arising in partnership.
These actions are distinguished from all others by the adjudicatio,
a clause in the formula which empowered the judex ΒΥ the mere
effect of his judgment to operate a transmutation of property.
They are called mixed actions ΒΥ ῙΠΡίαῑι, because both parties are
equally plaintiff and defendant, Dig. 44, 73 37, 13 by J ustinim,
because they are both real and personal, that is, embrace questions
both of ownership and obligation ; but were regarded by the jurists
as properly personal actione, because they contemplate a transfer of
property and condemnation of one or other of the parties, in· case
of inequality of apportionment, in pecuniary damages by way of
compensation.

The obligation of a heres to a legatee, enforceable ΒΥ actio legati
(condictio ex testamento), is another case of obligation quasi ex
contractu. The aditio of the hereditas may be regarded as a
