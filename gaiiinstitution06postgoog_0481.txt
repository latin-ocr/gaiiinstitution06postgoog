curandave, aut sarcinator sarcienda
vestimenta mercede certa acceperit,
eaque furto amiserit, ipse furti habet
actionem, non dominus3 quia do·
mini nihil interest ea non perisse,
cum iudicio locati a fullone aut
sarcinatore suum persequi possit, si
modo is fullo aut sarcinator ad rem
praestandam sufficiat; nam si sol·
vendo non est, tunc quia ab eo do-
minus suum consequi non potest,
ipsi furti actio competit, quia hoc
casu ipsius interest rem salvam
esse.

ξ 206. Quae de fullone aut sarci-
natore diximus, eadem transfere-
mus et ad eum cui rem commodavi-
mus: nam nt illi mercedem capi-
endo custodiam praestant, ita hic
quoque utendi commodum perci-
piendo similiter necesse habet cus·
todiam praestare.

ξ 207. Sed is aput quem res de·
posita est custodiam non praestat,
tantumque in eo obnoxius est, si
quid lpse dolo fecerit· qua de causa,
εἰ res ei subrepta fuerit quae resti-

rem salvam esse: furti itaque agere
non potest3 sed ea actio domino
competit.

quaesitum esse, an impubes rem

proximus pubertati sit, et ob id
intellegat se delinquere.

DE FU RTIS.

to be cleaned or finished or mended
for a certain remuneration, and then
are stolen, the fuller or tailor has
the action, and not the owner3 for
the owner is not prejudiced by the
loss, having his action of letting
against the bailee to recover the
value; supposing always, that the
bailee is able to make the loss good.
If the bailee is insolvent, the owner
cannot recover ont of him, and can
maintain an action against the thies ;
being, in this hypothesis, interested
in the loss of the property.

ξ 206. What has been said· of the
fuller and tailor applies to the bor·
rower ; for, as the remuneration
they receive makes them responsible
for custody, so the advantage the
borrower derives from the use of an
article requires him to keep it safely
at his peril.

ξ 207. As a depositary is not an·
swerable for the safe- keeping of the
thing deposited‚ but only for fraud, ¹
and, if it is stolen, is not com-
pellable to make restitution by
action of deposit, he is not interested
in its loss 3 and therefore the action
of thest is only maintainable by the
depositor.

§208. Finally, it is a question
whether a child below the age of
puberty, who carries away the pro·
perty of another, commits a theft;
and most agree that as theft de-
pends on intention, obligation by
theft is not incurred unless the
child, being near to puberty‚ under-
stands its delinquency.

Thest in modern systems of jurisprudence is a crime, that is,
belongs to the penal or criminal code. In Roman law, as in other
early systems, it is a private injury, and treated as a subject of the

civil code.

This was confirmed by the law of the Twelve TableS,

which allowed a compromise or composition for theft, that is,
allowed the obligation (liability to the legal sanction) thereby
