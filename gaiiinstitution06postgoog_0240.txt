legante, or a person who has power
over the heir or legatee, or a person
in the same power as the heir or
legatee, capable of being witness or

§lor A will is thus defined by Ulpian: Testamentum est
mentis nostrae justa contestatio, in id sollemniter facta, ut post
mortem nostram valeat, 20, 1. ‘A will is a duly attested de-
claration of intention, solemnly executed in order to operate after
death.' So important is the institution of a heres to the validity
of a will in Roman law, that a Roman testament might be simply
defined the institution of a heres.

Testamentary disposition was an interference with the more
ancient law of succession by descent or intestate devolution, and
the diversion of property from the legal course of transmission
seemed at first so great an innovation as to require legislative
sanction. Accordingly, the will executed in the Comitia Calata, or
convocation of the curiae, was really a private law; and even the
will in procinctu, when we remember the original identity at Rome
of the civil and military organization, may be regarded as a legis-

lative act of the people in military convocation.
The latter form was familiar to the contemporaries of Cicero:

Reprehendebat igitur Galbam Rutilius quod is . . . . duos filios suos
parvos tutelae populi commendasset ac se, tanquam in procinctu
testamentum faceret sine libra atque tabulis, populum Romanum
tutorem instituere dixisset illorum orbitati, De Orat. l, 53. ‘ Ru-
tilius blamed the abject artifice of Galba in commending his children
to the protection of the people, and, as if he was making a will on
the eve of battle, without bronze ingot and scale or written tablete,
exclaiming that he named the Roman people guardian of their
orphanage.'

began to supersede the older form as soon as the Twelve Tables had
given legal force to the nuncupative part of mancipation (Cum
nexum faciet mancipiumque, uti lingua nuncupassit, ita jus este,
