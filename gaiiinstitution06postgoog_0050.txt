28 DE PERSONIS. [1. ξς 1-7.

wh0‚ like the Praetor urbanus, published an annual edict an-
nouncing the principles on which justice would be administered.
These principles composed J us gentium as opposed to J us civium.
J us gentium, that is to say, was not really, as Roman jurists
imagined or represented, a collection of the principles common to
the legislation of all nations, but a body of rules which the Roman
praetor thought worthy to govern the intercourse of Roman citizens
with the members of all, originally independent but now subject,
foreign nations. Accordingly, if for the definition given by Gaius
we substitute the definition ‘ Quod edicto suo praetor peregrinus
omnibus gentibus constituit,' we shall be much nearer the truth.

Gradually the rules regulating the intercourse of citizens with
aliens were extended to the intercourse of citizens with citizens,
in cases where the rigorous conditions of jus civile were not exactly
satisfied, and the precepts of jus gentium were transferred from the
edict of praetor peregrinus to 'tbe edict of praetor urbanus.

Another organ of quasi publication, whereby the rules of jus ’
gentium were transformed from ideal law to positive law—from
laws of Utopia to laws of Rome—were the writings of the jurists,
who, at first with the tacit, afterwards with the express permission
of the legislature, engaged, nominally in interpreting, really in
extending the law, about the time of Cicero (De Legibus, 1, 5),
transferred to the edict of the praetor, the activity which they had
formerly displayed in developing the statutes of the Comitia and the
law of the Twelve Tables.

The portion of the edict most fertile in germs of natural law
would be the clauses in which the praetor announced, as he did
in some cases, that he would instruct the judeX, whom he appointed
to hear and determine a controversy, to govern himself by a
consideration of what was aequum et bonum, i.e. by his views of
equity and expediency: and if any of the oral formularies of the
earliest system of procedam (legis actiones) contained these or
equivalent terms, such formularies may be regarded as a third

source of Gentile or Natural law. Q
Jus civile, i.e. jus civium, was the law of the Twelve Tables,

augmented by subsequent legislation, byjuristic interpretation, and
by consuetudinary law, The institutions of jus civile may be
exemplified by such titles to property as Mancipatio and In
J ure CessiO, contracts by the form of Nexum and Sponsio, title
to intestato succession by Agnatio or civil relationship3 while
