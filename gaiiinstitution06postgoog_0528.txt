to avoid this was obliged to bring his action in the form of actio
Arbitraria, 4 ξ 53.

The division of actions into stricti juris and bonae fidei properly
speaking only embraces Personal actions founded on contract with
a formula in jus concepta: that is to say, Real action& Personal
actions with a formula in factum concepta, Personal actions on
delict, Extraordinaria cognitio (cognizance by the praetor without
reference to a judex) were neither stricti juris nor ex bona fide. It
is probable however that civil delictual actions (the actions furti
nec-manifesti and legis Aquiliae) were governed by the rules of
actions stricti juris 3 while Real actions, and actions in factum, and

cognitio extraordinaria were governed by the rules of actions ex
bona fide. Vangerow, ξ 139.
