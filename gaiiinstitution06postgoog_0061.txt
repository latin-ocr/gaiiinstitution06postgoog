of J ustinian mention Custom or Usage, the source of consue-
tudinary or customary law (jus non scriptum, consensu receptum,
moribus introductum). Το this branch of law are referred, with
other rules, the invalidity of donatione between husband and wife,
Dig. 24, 1, l, the power of making a will for an infant successor
who dies before the age of puberty (pupillaris substitutio), Dig.
28, 6, 2, and universal succession in Coemption and Adrogation,

in general, would fall into two divisione, civil law and Gentile law,
the former embracing what Roman writers sometimes speak of as
mores majorum. Before the time of Gaius, however, most, if not
all, of Customary law must have been taken up into the edict
of the praetor or the writings of the jurists, Cic. De Invent. 2, 22 3
i. e. unwritten law must have changed its character and have been
transformed into written law.

subordinate codes, like the different limbs and members of an
organic whole—what is the import of the Gaian division into jus
personarum, jus rerum, jus actionum, or rather, to adhere to the
classical phrases, jus ad personas pertinens, jus ad res pertinens,
jus ad actiones pertinens ? ⁸

By jus ad actiones pertinens, to begin with the easier part of the
problem, there is no doubt that the inventor of the division intended
to designate the law of PROCEDURE as opposed to the law of
rights; the adjective code, to use Bentham’s phraseology, as opposed
to the substantive code. There is as little doubt that in the Insti-
tutions of Gaius this design is not executed with precision, and
that, instead of the law of procedure, the last portion of his treatise Ἰ
rather contains the law of sanctioning rights, as opposed to the ,
law of primary rights. Or perhaps we should say that the legislative
