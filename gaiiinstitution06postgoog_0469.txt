111. §§ les-181] LITIS CONTESTATIO. 447

Under J ustinian Litis contestatio lost half of its effect: it still ξ
retained the positive function of generating a new obligation3 but ⁸
it ceased to have the negative function of extinguishing the old l
obligation. From this time, accordingly, we cease to hear of pro-
cess-consumption whether extinctive (litis consumptio ipso jure) as
relating to statutory actione, or counteractive (exceptio rei in judi-
cium deductae) as relating to actions dependent on the authority
of the praetor. Indeed the former of these (litis consumptio ipso·
jure) had disappeared long before, contemporaneously with the dis-
appearance of legitima judicia3 that is to say, with the abolition of
the ordo judiciorum (formulary system), and the transformation of
all procedure into cognitio extraordinaria.

Gaius attributes a Novative pow er not only to Litis contestatio,
but also to J udgment (res judicata). Judgment, like litis con· f
testatiO, has two functione, one Negative, the other Positive. By·
its Negative operation it extinguishes the previous right of action·
by its Positive it entitles‚ in the event of Condemnati0‚ to Execu-
tion. The Positive function is in the interest of the plaintiff : the
Negative principally in the interest of the defendant. Under J us-
tinian the novative effect of J udgment, as well as that of Litis con-
testatiO, was considerably altered. It was partly nan-owed: e. g. an
absolution on the ground of PBH„ petitio, 4 ᾧ 53, or of a dilatory ex-
ception, 4 § 120, no longer grounded an exceptio rei judicatae : and
it was partly extended: for instance it founded exceptio rei judicatae
not only in respect of the principal question, but also in respect of
incidental questions, whose decision was preliminary to that of the
principal question, and in respect of any exceptione or replicationS.
In view of these changes it is said that Res judicata, like Litis
contestatio, while it retained its positive functione, lost its negative
functions. But while it still generated an exceptio rei judicatae it
seems difficult to say that it ceased to have a negative or consump-
tive operation: though this was attenuated, and made more
rig-orously subsidiary to the positive operation 3 and was henceforth
left entirely to the discretiori of the praetor.

'I'he present seems to be the most convenient occasion that we
shall find for gathering together in one conspectus the various
operatione and effects of Litis contestatio: fuller explanations of
each will be found scattered over this treatise in connexion with the
various matters to which such operations relate. Χ
