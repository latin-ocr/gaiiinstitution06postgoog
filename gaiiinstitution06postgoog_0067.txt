the name is not intended to connote. For purposes of classi-
fication this branch of primary rights is of minor importance.

Unlike Status, Dominion, Obligation, Primordial rights are not

the ground of any primary division of the code.

The actions

founded on the infraction of Primordial rights partly belong to
the civil code of obligation arising from Tort (e. g. actio in-
juriarum), partly and principally to the criminal code.

β 12. As Gaius 1166 1101 marked very strongly the divisions of
1116 present book, it may be worth while to consider what are the
leading branchos of the doctrine of Status. Status falls under
three heads,—liberty (libertas), citizenship (civitas), and domestic
position (familia).

Under the first head, men are divided into free (liberi) and slaves
(servi): the free, again, are either free by birth (ingenui) or by
manumission (libertini). We have here, then, three classes to
consider: ingenui, libertini, servi.

Under the second head men were originally divided into citizens
(cives) and aliens (peregrini). The rights of citizens fall into two
branches‚ political and civil, the former being electoral and legisla-
tive power (jus suffragii) and capacity for office <jus honorum), the
latter relating to property (commercium) or to marriage (connu-
