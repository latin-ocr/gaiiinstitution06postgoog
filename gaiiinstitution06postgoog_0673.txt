As particular commands addressed to individuale, instead of
universal commands addressed to the community, Interdicts may
be regarded as survivals into a later and more organized stage of
society of the 'munaus (judgments anterior to law, the basis of
future law) of the primeval ruler. See Maine’s Ancient Law, p. 4.

But though originally the subjecta of the Inter-dict had been
omitted by the legislator, as matters rather of administration than
of legislation3 yet aster many individual Interdicts had been issued,
and their conditione had been generalized by the authorities of
jurisprudcnce3 aster moreover the rules which would be observed
in their issue had been announced by the magistrate in his annual
proclamation3 the area of questions decided by Interdict was
practically as much subject to law as any other department of
Roman life. 'I'he code of rules promulgated by the magistrate
(jus praetorium), being accepted ΒΥ the state, was just as much

law as if it had been enaeted by the legislative assemblies: so that -

finally Interdict procedure differed from ordinary litigation merely
ΒΥ a fringe of form, that served as a memento of its historic origin,
the extraordinary power of the magistrate in republican Rome:
and J ustinian in his Institutes devotes only a single sentence to
abolishing this fringe and assimilating procedure in the domain
once managed ΒΥ Interdict to the procedure employed in all the
other departments of the code, Inst. 4, 15, 8.

ξ 171. The defendant's denial of
his obligation is sometimes punished
ΒΥ the duplication of the damages
to be recovered. This occurs in an
action on a judgment debt, or for
money paid by a sponsor, or for in-
jurious damage, or for legacies left
in the form of judgment debt.
Sometimes a vager of a penal sum
is permitted, as in an action of loan,
or on a promise to pay a pre-existing
debt, in the former case of one third

of the sum in dispute, in the latter
of one half.
