dialis, and as such it vanished with vanishing paganism. The ten
witnesses apparently represented ‘the ten curiae of which the tribe
was composed, or the ten gentes of which the curia was composed,
or, if the decimal division continued further, the ten familias of
which the gens was composed.

The exact nature of Coemption, in consequence of the defective
state of the Veronese manuscript, must remain a mystery. Coemp-
tion was a form of mancipation, ᾧ 113, but in virtue of the provision
of theJI'welve Tables, Cum nexum faxit mancipiumque, uti lingua
nuncupassit, ita jus esto, ‘the nature of every mancipation depended on
the mancipii lex, the accompanyin g· nuncupatiou or verbal declara-
tion of its conditions, intentione, purposes3 as in English con-
veyancing the nature of a grant is limited and determined by the
habendum and tenendum of the deed. We are informed that in
coemption the formula was not the same as in other mancipations,
ᾧ 123, but we are not informed what it was. Even in Cicero’s
time many advocates were ignorant of the legal effect of a coemp-
tion because they were ignorant of the precise terms of the formula
in which it was concluded, De Orat. 1, 56. The word itself may
suggest a conjecture that it was a conveyance of the husband to
the wife as well as of the wife to the husband; and this is sup-
ported by Servius on Georgics, 1, 34, and Isidorus, 5, 24, no great
authorities, but who quoted apparently from Ulpian: Antiquus
nuptiarum erat ritus, quo se maritus et. uxor invicem emebant,
ne videretur ancilla uxor, ‘ An ancient nuptial form wherein hus-
band and wife made a mutual purchase‚ to bar the inference that
the wife became a slave? Plutarch informs us that the wife as-
serted her equality by the terme, Ubi tu Caius, ego Caia, Quaest.
Rom. 28: ‘ Where thou art master, I am mistress? Boethius on
Cicero Topica, 3, 14, quoting from Ulpian, says: Sese in coemendo
invicem interrogabant, vir ita: an sibi mulier materfamilias esse
vellet P illa respondebat velle. Item mulier interrogabat, an vir
sibi paterfamilias esse vellet? ille respondebat velle. Itaque mulier
viri conveniebat in manum, et erat mulier materfamilias viro,

loco filiae. ‘The man and woman interrogated one another. He

asked her if she wished to be mother of his household3 she an-
swered, Yes. She asked him if he wished to be father of her
household3 he answered, Yes. And thus the woman passed into
'the Hand of the man, and was called the mother of his household„
with the status of filiafamilias.' According to Cicero, the wife
