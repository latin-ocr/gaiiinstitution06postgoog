cum hac pactione in societatem
admitti. nam et ita posse coire
societatem constat, ut unus pecu-
niam conferat, alter non conferat,
et tamen lucrum inter eos com-
mune sit3 saepe enim opera alicuius

α pro pecunia valet.

ξ 150. Et illud certum est, si de
partibus lucri et damni nihil inter
eos convenerit, tamen aequis ex
partibus commodum et incommo-
dum inter eos commune esse. sed
si iu altero partes expressae fuerint
velut in lucro, in altero vero omis—
sae, in eo quoque quod omissum est
similes partes erunt.

ξ 151. Manet autem societas
eousque, donec in eodem sensu per·
severant: at cum aliquis renun-
tiaverit societati, societas solvitur.
sed plane si quis in hoc renuntia-
verit societati, ut obveniens aliquod
lucrum solus habeat, veluti si mihi
totorum bonorum socius, cum ab
aliquo heres esset relictus, in hoc
renuntiaverit societati, ut heredita-
tem solus lucrifaciat, cogetur hoc
lucrum communicare. si quid vero
aliud lucri fecerit quod non cap-
taverit, ad ipsum solum pertinet.
mihi vero, quidquid omnino post
renuntiatam societatem adquiritur,
soli conceditur.

ξ 152. Solvitur adhuc societas
etiam morte socii; quia qui socie-
tatem contrahit certam personam
sibi eligit.

153. Dicitur et capitis diminu-
tione solvi societatem, quia civili
ratione capitis diminutio morti ae-
quiparari dicitur: sed si adhuc
consentiant in societatem, nova
videtur incipere societas.

bona publice aut privatim venierint,

have a share ιιι the gains and none
in the losses, if the value of his ser-

vices made such an arrangement
fair. It is certain thatapartnership
may be formed on the terms that
one partner shall contribute all the
capital and that the gains shall be
divided equally, for a man's services
may be equivalent to capital.

§ 150. If no agreement has been
made as to the division of the profit
and loss, it must be in equal shares.
If the shares are expressed in the
event of profit but not in the event
of loss, the loss must be divided in
the same proportione as the profit.

ξ 151. The continuance of part·
nership depends on the continuing
consent of the members : the renun-
ciation of one dissolves the partner-
ship. If, however, the object of a
partner in renouncing the partner-
ship' is to monopolise some accruing
gain3 if, for instance, a partner in
all goods succeeds to an inheritance
and renounces the partnership in
order to have exclusive possession
of the inheritance, he will be com-
pelled to divide this gain with his
partners; but what he gains un·
designedly he keeps to himself ; and
his partner always has exclusive
benefit of whatever accrues to him
after the renunciation.

ξ 152. Dissolution of partnership
is also produced by the death of a
partner, for he who enters into
partnership elects a determinate
person with whom he is willing to
be partner.

ξ 153. Loss of status also deter-
mines partnership, because in the
civil law loss of status is regarded
as equivalent to death3 but if the
members still consent to be partners,
a new partnership commences.

§ 154. Again‚ the sale of all the
property of one of the partners,
