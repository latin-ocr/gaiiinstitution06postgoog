proprietary and family rights as limited aud protected by the civil
law (commercium and connubium), though they enjoyed corre-
sponding rights under the jus gentium. At a subsequent period
a third class were intercalated between cives and peregrini, namely,
latini, devoid of the political portion of the franchise, and enjoying
only a portion of the private franchise, commercium without con-
nubium. Here also, then, we have three classes, civeS, latini, pere-
gnm.

The powers of the head of a family were nominally three,
potestas, manus, mancipium: potestas, however, was either potestas

dominica, power over his slaves, or potestas patria, power over his
children, which, at the period when· Roman law is known to ue,

were different in kind; so that the rights of paterfamilias were
really fourfold. Manus or marital power placed the wife on the
footing of filiafamiliaS‚ which was the same as that of filiusfamilias.
Paterfamilias had a legal power of selling (mancipare) his children
into bondage; and mancipium, as denoting a person, designated
a filiusfamilias who had been sold by his parent as a bondsman
to another paterfamilias, In respect of his purchaser, such a bonds-
man was assimilated to a slave: in respect of the rest of the world,
he was free and a citizen, though probably his political capacities
were suspended as long as his bondage (mancipii causa) lasted.
As slaves are treated of under the head of libertas, and the status
of the wife (manus) was exactly the same as that of the son, we
may say, that in respect of domestic dependence or independence
(familia), as well as in respect of libertas and civitaS, men are
divided into three classes, —paterfamiliaS‚ filiusfamilias, and man-
cipium 3 paterfamilias alone being independent (sui juris), the other
two being dependent (alieni juris) in unequal degrees.

These nine classes are not examined by Gaius with equal minute-
ness. Under the first head he principally examines the libertini:
the classes under the second head, cives„ latini, peregrini, are only
noticed indirectly, i. 0. 30 far as they present a type for the classifi-
cation of libertini; and the bulk of the first book of the Institutions
is devoted to domestic relations.

In modern jurisprudence, Status having disappeared, the law of
domestic relations—the relation of husband to wife, parent to child,
guardian to ward—constitutes the whole of that of which formerly
it was only a part, the law of PersonS. It differs from the rest of the
civil code in that, while the relations of Property and Obligation
