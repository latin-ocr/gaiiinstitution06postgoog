‘adolescentulo grandi foenore, fiducia tamen accepta, occupavisti.
Hanc fiduciam commissam tibi dicis, tenes hodie ac possideat, Cic.
Pro FlaccO, 21. ‘ You lent the youth money at an enormous inter-
est, although secured by mortgage. This mortgage you say is
forfeited‚ and you have taken possession.’ 'Phe creditor’s right of
forfaiture or foreclosure (commissio) was gradually limited. A
power of sale was inherent in such a mortgage. Si inter creditorem
et debitorem convenerit ut fiduciam sibi vendere non liceat, non
solvente debitore creditor denuntiare ei sollenniter potest et dis-
trahere: nec enim ex tali conventione fiduciae actio nasci potest,
Pauli Sent. 2, 13, 5. ‘ Notwithstanding an agreement that the
pawnee shall have no power to sell the pawn, on default of the
pawnor to pay, and after formal notice the pawnee may proceed to

sale, nor would such an agreement give the pawnor an action of
fiducia? But the pawnee could not become the purchaser. De-

bitor creditori fiduciam vendere non potest sed aliis si velit vendere
potest, ita ut ex pretio ejusdem pecuniam offerat creditori atque ita
remancipatam sibi rem emptori praestat. Si per suppositam per-
sonam creditor pignus suum invito debitore comparaverit, emptio
non videtur et ideo quandoque lui potest, ex hoc enim causa pig·-
noris vel fiduciae finiri non potest, Pauli Sent. 2, 13, ᾧ 3, 4. ‘ The
debtor may sell the pawn to any but the creditor, and paying the
creditor with the purchase-money may have the pawn remancipated
to himself and convey it to the purchaser. If the pawnee buy in
the pawn by means of a collusive bidder, the sale is void, and the
pawn may be redeemed at any time, for such a proceeding cannot
extinguish the right of the pawnor.’

Mortgage by Mancipatio and Fiducia (see 2 ᾧ 60) are illustrated
by an inscription on a brazen tablet‚ recently discovered near the
mouth of the Guadalquivir, of which Krueger gives the text and
explanation in his Kritische Versuche.

The perforated margins of the tablet still contain the bronze
nails by which it was attached to a wall. It is supposed to have
belonged at latest to the second century after the Christian era,
and to have been suspended in the chamber of a banker (argen-
tarius, 4 ᾧ 64). The inscription is supposed not to have been an
actual mortgage but the common form of a mortgage‚ indicating
the terms on which the banker was willing to accommodate his

eustomers. It runs as follows:
