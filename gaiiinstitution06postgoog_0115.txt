ξ 110. In former days there were
three modes of beeoming subject to
Hand, possession, confarreation, co-
emption.

§ 111. Possession invested the
husband with right of Hand after a
whole year of unbroken cohabita-
tion. Such annual possession ope-
rated a kind of usucapion, and
brought the wife into the family
of the husband, where it gave 1101·
1110 3181113 of a daughter. Accord-
ingly, the law of the Twelve Tables
provided that a wife who wished to
avoid subjection to the Hand of the
husband should annually absent her-
self three nights from bis roof to
bar the annual usucapion: but this
proceeding is partly abolislned by
statute, partly obliterated by mere
disuse.

ξ 112. confarreation, another
mode in which subjection to Hand
originates, is a sacrifice in which
they nse a cake of spelt, whence the
ceremony derives its name, and
various other acts and things are
done and made in the solemni—
zation of this disposition with a
traditional form of words, in the
presence of ten witnesses: and this
ceremony is still in use, for the
functions of 1110 greater flamens,
that 13, 1110 flamens of Jove, of
Mars, of Quirinus, and the duties
of 1110 ritual king, 088 only be per-
formed by persons born in marriage
solemnized by confarreation.

ξ 113. In coemption the right of
Hand over 8 woman 13 vested in a
person to whom she is conveyed by
a mancipation or imaginary sale in
the presence of at least five wit-
nesses, citizens of Rome above the
age of puberty‚ besides a balance
holder, for an As or ingot of bronze.
