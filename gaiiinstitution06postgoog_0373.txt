emptio vested quiritary property in the vendee, and some expositore
have conjectured that he alluded to bonorum sectio. Some criminal
condemnatione involved confiscation, and the sale of the criminal’s
estate was conducted not by a magister but by a quaestor of the
treasury, who sold under the spear, the symbol of quiritary dominion.
Sectio bonorum passed quiritary property and transferred the juris
universitas of the criminal. It is alluded to, 3 §154, 4 §146. Bonorum
cessis, as we are expressly informed, Cod. 7, 71, 4, only gave the credi-
tors a power of sale and did not invest them with quiritary dominion.

The following observatione may serve to supplement the brief
remarks of Gaius on the subject of Insolvency ε

Bankruptcy proceedings are a partial execution, and therefore
belong, not to the law of Dominion, but to the law of Obligation or
the law of Procedure. The latter, as we have already noticed, has
some clemente which are not purely formal, but material, and as
such are rightly admitted to a treatise on substantive law. Insol-
vency is placed by Gaius in the sphere of Dominion or Real rights,
because in his day insolvency occasioned a transfer of a universitaS,
which was deemed to be a jus in rem. In later Roman law no
such transfer occurred.

Proceedings in Insolvency may be divided into two portione, of
which one is (A) preparatory, and the other (B) final.

(A) The preparatory portion includes the Proof of their debts by
the several creditore ; the collection of the. assets or formation of the
‘Massa ; and its sale. The collection of the assets includes, on the
one hand, the recovery back of property that has been aliened in
fraudem creditorum3 and, on the other, the elimination or separa-
tion from the mass of such things found in the possession of the

insolvent as were not really his property but the property of other
persons called Separatists.

Separatist claimants are those claimants

(1) Who can sue for a thing by any form of Real action, whether
a rei vindicatiO, or actio Publiciana, or hereditatis petitio, or actio
confessoria brought to recover some Personal servitude like usus-
fructus. An actio confessoria to enforce a Real servitude is obviously
not an interest of a nature to give a right of Separation. These
who had a pignus or hypotheca were also ranked by the Romans
among the Separatists: in German civil law they take their place
among the creditore proper or concurrent.

(2) Or Separatists are claimants who have a Personal action·
