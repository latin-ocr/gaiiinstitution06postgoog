enforced. Thus a merely naturalis obligatio, though not action-
able, might (1) furnish a ground of an equitable defence (exception):
for instance, on payment of a merely natural debt the receiver has
a right of retention, and can bar the suit to recover it back as a
payment made in error (condictio indebiti soluti) by pleading the
naturalis obligatio, Dig. 12, 6, 643 or the defendant can meet a
claim by Compensatio, 4 ξ 61, cross demand or set-off, of a debt
that merely rests on naturalis obligatio, Dig. 40, ’7, 20, 2; or a
naturalis obligatio might (2) form the basis of an accessory obliga-
tion, such as Suretyship (fidejussio) Dig. 46, 1, 6, 2, or Guaranty
(constitutum) Dig. 13, 5, 1, 7, or Mortgage (pignus) Dig. 20, 1, 5,
pr. or Novation, 3 ᾧ 176, Dig. 46, 2, 1, 1, all Civil institutions
and direct grounds of action. Though these rights and obligations
of Gentile law are imperfect (obligatio tantum naturalis) as not
furnishing immediate grounds of action, yet, as being partially and
indirectly enforced by Roman tribunale, they clearly compose a
portion of Positive law.

Some Roman jurists distinguished J us naturale and J us gentium.
Thus Ulpian denotes by J us naturale the law governing the relation
of the sexes, i.e. the relation of husband and wife, parent and
children, relations anterior to political society, and without which
the race would not have been perpetuated ε while by J us gentium
he denotes relations that imply the existence of political society.

Modern writers would denote by J us gentium the generally
recognized principles of justice, principles which may be discovered
by an induction of positive laws, that is, by a compat-ison of actually
existing legislatione, to be universally admitted, or, if not univer-
sally, by a majority or by a number of nations; while by Natural
law they would denote a philosophie ideal, what might be other-
wise denominated the moral law or the divine law, the law that
ought to be eyerywhere established, though perhaps never yet
adopted in actual legislation. Gaius, however, in the following
commentuy uses the terms J us naturale and J us gentium as per-
fectly synonymous and interchangeable.

ᾧ 3. 'Po explain the various sources of Roman law is to write
the history of the successive changes in the centre of gravity of
sovereign power at Rome. These changes are principally at first
the changing relations of Populus and Plebs, at which we r '.e
a hasty glauce, as the account given by Gaius is inadequate and
misleading.
