612 DE Ao'momsus. [ιν. §5 115-137.

absolve, are inapplicable. The cause is not heard, and the right
of action cannot have been consumed when it has never been
exercised.

In the legislation of J nstinian ‚ no dilatory exception was a bu
to a subsequent institution of a suit. Savigny, ᾧ 227.

ῤ 124. The disability of an infamous person (infamis) to create
a procurator or to discharge the office of procurator was abolished
by Justinian, Inst. 4, 13, 11.

ᾗ 126. The following instances of Replicatio may be found in
the Digest. A general agent could not be sued by another agent
without express authority. A plaintiff who has such authority will
meet the exceptio of the defendant, alleging general agency, by a
replicatio alleging special instructions to sue the defendant: Aut
si mihi mandatum est ut a te peterem, Dig. 3, 3, 48.

If a woman acting as gual-antor in contravention of Sc. Vellei-
anum sell and deliver her land to the creditor, she can recover it
back by a real action; and meet the exceptio alleg-ing sale and
delivery by a replicatio alleging the contravention of Sc. Vellei-
anum: Aut si ea venditio contra senatusconsultum facta sit, Dig.
16, 1, 32, 2.

Another text observes that an equality of fraud on the part
of plaintiff and defendant is more adverse to the plaintiff than
to the defendant, because an exceptio of the defendant alleg-ing
fraud on the part of the plaintiff is not allowed to be met by
a replicatio of the latter alleging fraud on the part of the de·
fendant: Aut si rei quoque in ea re dolo actum sit, Dig. 50,
17, 154.

The Replicatio, then, if we trust these examples, was a proposition
beginning with the words Aut si: and, if this was universal, we
must suppose that the expression of Gaius, Si non postea convenerit
ut eam pecuniam petere liceret, ᾗ 126, only gives the substance of
the replicatio, not the precise terms in which it was introduced by
the praetor into the formula.

Ulpian, Dig. 44, 1, 2, 3, and Julian, Dig. 27, 10, 7, l, 2, differ
from Gaius in the use of the words Duplicatio ,and Triplicatio.
They identify Duplicatio with Replicatio; and consequently nse
Triplicatio to signify an averment which Gaius would call Dupli-
catio,

ᾗ 130. The Praescriptio in favour of the plaintiff became obsolete
so soon as the old doctrine respecting litis consumptio was abrogated
