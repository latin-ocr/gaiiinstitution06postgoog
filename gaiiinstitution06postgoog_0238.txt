field before the enemy, martial array
denoting an army clad and armed
for battle. One kind, then, was
used in time of peace, the other in
time of war.

5102. More recently, a third
kind was introduced, affected by
bronze and balance. A man who
had not made his will, either in the
comitia calata or in martial army,
being in apprehension of approach-
ing death, used to convey his estate
by mancipation to a friend, whom
he requested to distribute it to cer-
tain persons in a certain manner
after his death. This mode of tes-
tamentary disposition is called the
will by bronze and balance, because
it involves the process of mancipa-
tion.

§ 103. The first two modes have
fallen into desuetude, and that by
bronze and balance, which alone sur·
vives, has undergone a transforma-
tion. In former times the vendee
of the estate, the alienee by manci·
pation from the testator, was the
successor, and received the tes-
tator’s instructions respecting the
disposition of his property after his
death. At the present day, the
person who is instituted successor,
and who is charged with the execu-
tion of the bequcsts, is different
from the person who, for form’s
sake, and ιιι imitation of the ancient
process, represents the purchaser.

§104. The proceedings are as
follows. The testator having sum·
moned‚ as is done in other manci-
pations, five witnesses‚ all Roman
citizens of the age of puberty, and
a holder of the balance, and having
already reduced his will to writing,
makes a fictitious mancipation of
his estate to a certain vendee,
who thereupon utters these words:
‘Thy family and thy money into
my charge, ward, and custody I
