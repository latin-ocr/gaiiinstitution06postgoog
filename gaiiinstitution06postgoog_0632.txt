610 DE Acmomssus. [ιν. §5 115-137.

table to the plaintiff, could not be alleged against a parent or
patron, but had to be conver-ted into an exception of fact, Dig. 44,
4, 4, 16.

Bona fides implies the absence of dolus: so sar then as the ex-
ceptio merely empowered the judex to take into consideration
equitable grounds of defence, no exceptio doli was necessary in
actions ex bona fide, for here the commission of the judex expressly
authorizcd him in the intentio of the formula to decide upon equit-
able grounds (ex bona fide): J udicium bonae fidei continet in se
doli mali exceptionem, Dig. 30, 1, 84, 5: Doli exceptio inest de
dote actioni, ut in ceteris bonae fidei judiciis, Dig. 24, 3, 21. This,
however, does not apply to the exceptio rei judicatae and others
like exceptio cognitoria and litis dividuae, which are founded
rather on political than on equitable consideratione, and had to
be expressed in the formula, if they formed the defence of the de·
fendant, even in actions ex bona fide. So a set-off (compensatio)
of an independent debt was required to be announccd in an ex·
ceptio,

Cicero gives the form of exceptio doli contained in the edictum
Asiaticum of Q. Mucius: Extraquam si ita negotium gestum est
ut eo stari non oporteat ex fide bona, Ad Att. 6, l, ‘ unless the

circumstances of the disposition make its enforcement inconsistent - ,

with the principles of good saith! This seems to be impersonally
framed, but the formula, as stated, may be incomplete.

The exceptio doli from the comprehensiveness of its meaning,
does not sufficiently disclose the line of defence which a defendant
intends to pursue: accordingly, in Germany, the fact which consti-
tutes the dolus is always required to be specified.

Property became litigious (reg litigiosa, § 117) as soon as it was
the subject of litis contestatio. O‘ffginally it was only the plain-
tiff (non-possessor) who was prohibited from alienation. An edict
os Augustus prohibited the alienation of litigatcd Italic land by
a non-possessing plaintiff in terma which explain why an exceptio
was necessary in order to repel the claims of the alienes. Qui
contra edictum divi Augusti rem litigiosam a non possidente com-
paravit, praeter quam quod emptio nullius momenti est, poenam
quinquaginta sestertiorum fisco repraesentare compellitur: sed hoc
in provincialibus fundis prava usurpatione obtinuit. Fragmentum
de jure fisci. ‘ If, in contravention of the edict of Augustus, a
subject of litigation is purchased of a vendor not in possession,
