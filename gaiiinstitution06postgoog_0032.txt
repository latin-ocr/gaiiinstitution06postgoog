10 PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS.

not punishable without an Overt act, and the mere intention to
dispose without execution produces no legal effect. But the overt
act which clothes the wrongful intention must have a physical
character, must be some change in the material universe ε· the
external act in which a Disposition is incorporated may be merely,
and usually is merely, a Declaration, whether Formal, that is, a
manifestation of intention by some symbolic act prescribed by
positive law, or Formless, that is, a manifestation of intention by
any mode which the disposer chooses to adopt. In Roman law
there is, however, this distinction between Dispositions that pro·
duce jus in personam or obligation and those that produce jus in
rem or dominion, that jus in personam is produced ΒΥ mere declara-
tion3 jus in rem generally requires in addition to declaration a
certain physical accompaniment, namely, Tradition.

A further comparison of Wrongs and Dispositions will be facil'
tated by the employment of certain logical formulae, of which some

kreaders may require a brief explanation.

. Every legal phenomenon may be presented in the form of a

hardly necessary to say, is resolvable into three terms, whose com-
binations compose three propositions, a major premiss, a minor
premiSS, and a conclusion. In the major premiss the major term is
found to be connected with the middle term3 in the minor premiss
the middle term is found to be connected with the minor term:
in the conclusion the minor term is from these data infer-red toobe
connected with the major term. If the major, middle, and minor
terms are respectively represented by the letters A, B, C, the
following symbols will give the formula of the syllogism:

- l Major premiss: all B is A;
Minor premiss: C is B;
conclusion: therefore C is A.

In the juristic syllogism the middle term B represents a Title,
i. e., a clasS, a category‚ or condition, to which the legislator has
annexed certain legal consequenceS‚ certain rights or obligations;
which are represented by the major term A3 the major premiss, all
B is A, representing the law. The minor term C represents certain
particular persons, plaintiff or defendant, as characterised ΒΥ certain
acts or omissione, volitions and knowledge : and the minor premiss,
