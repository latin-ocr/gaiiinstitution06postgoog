lv. ξς 45-52.] FORMULA ARBITRARIA. 533

tentio—formula-certa, would be capable of plus petitio: while an
actio with a formula in jus concepta, though based substantially on
the same grounds, having an intentio-formula—incerta, would be
incapable of plus petitio, ᾧ 60.

(2) Novatio was only produced byLitis contestatio when the
formula was in jus concepta, ξ 107.

'Phe words Nisi restituat are the clause which constitutes a
formula arbitraria. In the formulary system the condemnation
was always pecuniary3 the defendant was always condemned by
the judgment to pay the plaintiff a sum of money. By meam,
however, of the alternative clause in a formula arbitraria the
plaintiff could recover a specific thing or enforce a specific per-
formance. Empowered by this clause the judex made a preliminary
order (jussuS, arbitrium) for the restitution or performance3 and
if it was obeyed the defendant was absolved, if it was disobeyed the
pecuniary condemnation was the penalty of disobedience.

Actiones arbitrariae included Real actions (e. g. vindicatio, pub-
liciana‚ hereditatis petitio, confessoria, hypothecaria) and such bona
fide actions (e. g. depositi, commodati, locati, tutelae, rei uxoriae)
and praetorian actions (e. g. doli, metus, interdictum de vi, ἧ 163)
as were brought to obtain Restitution. 'Phe formula arbitraria,
accordingly, could not be used in an actio empti, for though this
was a bona fide action, yet the specific performance (traditio) sought
to be enforced was not of the nature of a Restitution: nor could the
formula arbitraria be employed in actions stricti juriS, i. e. either
condictions or actions founded on delict.

Of the formula arbitraria in a real action we have an instance in
Cicer0‚ Lucius Octavius judex esto, Si paret fundum capenatem,
quo de agitur, ex jure Quiritium [Auli Agerii] esse, neque is fundus ¹
[Aulo Agerio] restituetur, In Verrem, 2, 2, 12. In an action for ¹
the production as a preliminary to the restitution of a person or
thing (ad exhibendum) the clause would be of the form nisi exhibeat,
and generally some special modification of nisi actori satisfaciat.
In noxal actions there was probably no clause nisi noxae dedat, but
the judgment was of the form Publium Maevium Lucio Titio decem
aureis condemno aut noxam dedere, Inst. 4, 17; for the defendant
was intended to exercise the election of paying damages or surren-
dering the author of the mischief. But in other actions no such
discretion was intended to be given, and the damages were meant
as a penal sum to enforce obedience to the judge’ s order. This
