commencement of possession: no such condition is attached to
Limitation or temporalis praescriptio,

English law originally only recognized Usucapion in the case of
incorporeal hereditaments or servitudes, e.g. rights of way3 for the
acquisition of which the Prescription Act, 2 and 3 Will. 4, c. 71,
requires possession during twenty yearS. Here we seem, at first
sight, to have a remarkable divergence between English and Roman
jurisprudence: for we have seen that the lex Scribonia, D. 41, 3, 4,
29, abolished the usucapion of Servitudes, the one kind of he-
reditament in which acquisitive prescription was recognized by
English law. 'I'he divergence, however, is not so great as it ap·
pears3 for the lex Scribonia was partially defeated by the juristS,
who recognized the establishment of Servitudes by longa quasi
possessio, diuturnus usus, longi temporis consuetudo, D. 8, 5, 10.
This differed from usucapion by not requiring either titulus or bona
fides, but merely the absence of violence, secrecy, and permission
(nec vi, nec clam, nec precario). It was completed in ten years if
the parties were domiciled in the same province3 otherwise, in
twenty years. 'Phe right established by this acquisitive prescription
was enforced by actio utilis. Moreover, since the Act for the limi-
tation of real actions, 3 and 4 Will. 4, c. 27, deprives a proprietor of
land of his right as well as his remedy if he omit to bring his action
to recover it within twenty years after the right accrued, Usucapion
(Aequisitive prescription) in corporea] as well as incorporeal he-
reditaments may be said to be recognized in English law.

Whether Proscription, as distinct from Usueapion, extinguishes
natural as well as civil right and obligation‚ is a matter of con-
troversy. In the sphere of Real action Prescription only extin-
guished the action not the right, O. 7, 39, 8, l, so that if a
proprietor is barred by prescription from asserting his dominion
against a mala fide possessor, his right of action nevertheless revives
against any third person who obtains possession. In Persona]
actions, according to Savigny, an obligatio naturalis remains aster
Prescription: but according to Vangerow, it is certain that no natu-
ralis obligatio remains after the prescription of actio temporalis, i.e.
an action with a short period of prescription3 and we may conclude
that none remains after prescription of actio perpetua. This ques-
tion, however, belongs to the code of procedure, 4 § 110.

Besides the civil titles which we have examined, two others are
mentioned by Ulpian : singularum rerum dominia nobis adquiruntur
