moral or impossible conditione. The Prussian code follows a middle
course: impossible conditions invalidate a testamentary disposition ;
immoral conditione are deemed unwritten and the disposition is
construed as unconditional.

A Condition was not annexable to all dispositione. It was an-
nexable to all Testamentary dispositione: but among dispositions
inter vivos the only ones to which it could, at least in the earlier
jurisprudence‚ be annexed were Obligations. A Condition could
not be annexed to an In jure cessio or judicial surrender: Nulla
legis actio prodita est de sutum, Frag. Vat. 49. Nor to Manci-
patio‚ nor to AcceptilatiO, nor to Expensilatio (Literal Obligation)
nor to Cognitoris datio. Sub conditione cognitor non recte datur,
non magis quam mancipatur, aut acceptum vel expensum fertur,
Frag. Vat. 329. Nor could it be annexed to magisterial Tutoris
datio: Sub conditione a praesidibus provinciarum non posse dari
tutorem placet, et si datus sit nullius esse momenti dationem, Dig.
26, 1, 6, 1 : nor to Tutoris auctoritas-Dig. 26, 8, 8: nor to heredi-
tatis aditio, nor to servi optio: Actus legitimi qui non recipiunt
diem vel conditionem, veluti mancipati0‚ acceptilatiO, hereditatis
aditio, servi optio, datio tutoris, in totum vitiantur per temporis
vel conditionis adjectionem, Dig. 50, 1⁷, ⁷7.

Later jurisprudence admitted the annexation of conditions to
the alienation of property by means of Tradition. Conditions are
Suspensive or Resolutive. Tradition coupled with a Suspensive
condition operates an immediate transfer of possession and a future
transfer of ownership contingent on, and contemporaneous with,
the fulfilment of the condition, p. 202. Tradition‚ coupled with
a Resolutory condition, operates two transfers of ownership: an
immediate transfer of ownership and a subsequent retransfer of
ownership, contingent on, and contemporaneous with, the fulfilment
of the condition. The retransfer of dominion follows without any
retradition or reconveyance by the interim proprietor 3 and the
remedy of the original proprietor is not condictio, implying the
necessity of reconveyance, but vindicatio, implying that he is
already reinvested with dominion. The justa causa or disposition
which accompanies the tradition and determines the transfer of
property (2 ξ 20), also limits the duration of the property so trans-
ferred. Such at least is the doctrine of the majority of jux-ists:
others hold that the fulfilment of the resolutive condition only
imposes on the transferree a personal obfilifftion of reconveyance.
