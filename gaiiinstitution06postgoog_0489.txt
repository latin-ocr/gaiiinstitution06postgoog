111.§§ 210-219.]

pedem quae pecudum numero · sit,
iniuria occiderit, quanti ea res in
eo anno plurimi fuerit, tantum
domino dare damnetur.

ξ 21 1. Is iniuria autem occidere
intellegitur cuius dolo aut culpa id
acciderit, nec ulla alia lege damnum
quod sine iniuria datur reprehen-
ditm· .· itaque inpunitus est qui sine
culpa et dolo malo casu quodam
damnum committit.

5212. Nec solum corpus in ac-
·tione 11111118 legis· aestimatum sed
sane si servo occiso plus dominus
capiat damni quam pretium servi
sit, id quoque aestimatur· velut si
servus meus ab aliquo heres institu-
tus, ante quam iussu meo heredita-
tem cerneret, occisus fuerit3 non
enim tantum ipsius pretium aesti-
matur, sed et hereditatis amissae
quantitas, item si ex gemellis vel
ex comoedis vel ex symphoniacis
unus occisus fuerit, non solum oc-
cisi fit aestimatiO, sed eo amplius
quoquc computatur quod ceteri qui
supersunt depretiati sunt. idem
iuris est etiam si ex pari mularum
unam, vel etiam ex quadrigis equo-
rum unum occiderit

§21:3. Cuius autem servus oc-
cisus est, is liberum arbitrium habet
vel capitali crimine reum facere eum
qui occiderit, vel hac lege damnum
persequi.

ξ 214. Quod autem adiectum est
in hac lege: Quium m Eo mo
rnmmu EA uns rum, illud effi-
cit, si clodum puta aut luscum ser-
vum occiderit, qui in eo anno in-
teger fuerit, ut non quanti mortis
tempore, sed quami in eo anno plu-
rimi fierit, aestimatio fiat. quo fit,
ut quis plus interdum consequatur
qnam ei damnum datum est.

DE LEGE AQUILIA.

467

quadruped of his cattle, be unlaw-
fully slain, whatever within a year
was the highest value thereos, that
amount the offender shall payto
the owner.

§211.Un1awful slaying means
slaying by intention or negligence3
for it is only disobedience to law
that 18 punished and m the absence,
of intention and negligence there
is no penalty for fortuitous damage.

ξ 212. It 18 not only the body of
the slave or animal slain that 1s ap·
praised, but if the death of a slave
occasion to the owner the loss of
anything in addition to his price,
this loss is further estimated3 for
instance, if my slave has been insti-
tuted somebody¹s heir, and before
by my order 118 has signified his
acceptanoe, he 18 slain, valuation is
made not only of his body but also
of the inheritance I have missed3
or if one of tw0 twins, or one of a
company of players, or one of a
band of musicians is slain, an esti-
mate is made not only of his value
but also of the extent to which the
remainder are depreciated. The
same holds if one of a pair of
ιῑιιιέῧῗ, or one of four chariot horsea
18 ed.

§2 13. The owner whose slave
is killed has the option of accusing
the homicide of a capital crime 01·
of suing him under this law for
damages.

ξ 214. From the words of this
law, ‘Whatever within a year was
the highest value thereofss it follows
that if a slave was lame or blind of
one eye when 118 was slain, but had
been sound within a year, as it is
not his value at the time of his
death bnt his highest value within
a year that 18 appraised, a plaintiff
will sometimes recover more than
the amount of the loss he has sus-
tained.
