defendant in a vindication.’ In Personal actions the defendant is
not called possessor.

Tho owner of a servitude (jus in re) has 110 possession. Usu·
fructuarius usucapere servum non potest quia non possidet, Dig. 41
1, 10, 5. ‘The usufructuary has no usucapion, for he has no pos-
session.' Naturaliter videtur possidere is qui usumfructum habet,
Dig. 41, 2, 12. ‘ 'I'he usufructuary has mere detention.’

[It would be a fallacy to argue that occupation is pfflession
because it is naturalis pooeessio, just as it would be to argue that
nine is ten because it is ten minus one, for an epithet sometimes
detracta from, instead of adding to, the connotation of a wonl]

As the usufructuary has no possession, it follows a fortiori that
the usuary has no possession. [Although the jus in re called usus
must be distinguished from possession, the words usucapio, usurpatio
show that in the older language usus=possessio.]

Servitudes, though not the subject of possession, were the sub-
ject of quasi-possession, ξ 139, 0. g. Fundi possessionem vel usus-
fructus quasi possesdonem, Dig. 4, 6, 23, 2: Si quis longa quasi
possessione jus aquae ducendae nactus sit, Dig. 8, 5, 10: which
was called juris possessio in contradiction to true possession or
corporis possessi03 Possessionem vel corporis vel juris, Dig. 43, 26,
2, 3: though if juris possessio was the proper name for possession
of a fraction of property, possession that bore the same relation
to the totality of property should have been called, not corporis
possessi0, but dominii possessio.

The quasi-possession of servitudes, like the possess'ion of corporeal
things, was protected by interdicts. The possession of rural servi-
tudes, such as iter, actus, via, jus aquae ducendae, eze„ was pro-
tected by special interdicte. · 0. g. Quo itinere actuque privato, quo de
agitur, vel via hoe anno nec vi nec clam 1100 precario ab illo usus es,
quo minus ita utaris, vim fieri vet0, Dig.43, 19. ‘'l'he font-way,
horse-way, carriage-way in question, which thou hast used within a
year without violence, clandestinity, or permission in respect of the
adversary, the violent hindrance of thy continuing to use I prohibit!

Urbane servitudes, whether positive, as jus tigni immittendi, or
negative, as jus altius non tollendi, being closely· connected with
possession of an immovable, according to Savigny, were always
protected by Uti possidetis: according to Vangerow‚ the pro-
tection of the status quo was always by interdictum Quod vi
aut clam or Operis novi nuntiatio, ξ 355. Personal servitudes,
