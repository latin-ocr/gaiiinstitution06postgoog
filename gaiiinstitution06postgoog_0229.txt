Accaesio ‘?) to the owner of the matter, the Proculeians (by Oc-
cupatio ‘?) to the producet of the form. J ustinian adopts an inter-
mediate opinion, which Gaius mentions, Dig. 41, l, 7, ’7, that the
product belongs to the producor, provided that it cannot be reduced
to the original substance, in which case it belongs to the owner
of that substance3 e. g. a vessel belongs to the owner of the gold
or silvei· out of which it was made: and provided further that
the change is a genuine fabrication or manufacture3 for instance,
the mere thrashing out of corn is not sufficient to change the
ownership‚ and therefore the corn belongs to the owner of the
sheaves: and the mere dying of wool operates no transfer of owner-
ship to the dyer, D. 41, 1, 26, 3.

In the subjoined synopsis of the various titlcs to dominion which
have been considered the proper position of Specification is open ’ω

Aequisition is either Derivative (implying Succession) or
Original.

Derivative acquisition is Alienation: which includes In jure

cessio, Mancipatio, Traditio, Fructuum perceptio, Adjudi-
catio·

Original acquisition is either independent of Possession or
depends on Possession.

Original acquisition independent of Possession is either the
effect of Separation or of Conjunction.

Separation is a title to property in the case of Separatio
fructuum, which confers property in the fruits on the
bona fide possessor.

conjunction is either the conjunction of equal with equal
or the conjunction of accessory with principal.

'I'he conjunction of equal with equal is seen in Con-
fusio, which produces communio or co-proprietor-
ship.

'I'he conj unction of accessory with principal is either
of immovable with immovable, instanced in Al-
luvio:

or of movable with immovable, instanced in Satio,
Plantatio, Inaedificatio:
