be oondemned in the amount recoverable in the wrongly deoided
suit. (2) If any thing is thrown out of a window and occasioned
damage, the paterfamilias oocupying the room is liable to twice the
value of the damage, although the thing was thrown by some other
person. (3) If any thing is suspended dangerously over a place of
public 103011, 1110 paterfamilias in occupation is liable to a penalty
of ten aurei. If a filiusfamilias is residing apart from his father,
and the thing is throwu or suspended from his window, the filius-
familias and not the father is liable. ‘l'he last two actions are
populares, that is, the damages are recoverable by a common in-
former. (4) If 111011 or malicious mischief is committed in an 11111

owner are 1131110 111 twice the value.

If we ask why an unskilful surgeon 01 physician is liable for a
delict, Inst. 4, 3, ¹7, whereas an ignorant judge is only liable for a
quasi delict, the only answer is, that an unskilful surgeon or physi-
eian comes within the terms of 1110 lex Aquilia, for the damage
is caused by a body to a body, and the ignorant judge does not. It
is observable that all the quasi delicts are, rationally speaking,
genuine delicts, and apparently 310 only excluded in Roman law
from the category of (1011013 because they fall under no certain
statute, or because they are recent additions to the code, not from ,
any inferior degree of culpability3 for even the shipowner and inn-
keeper are to a certain extent blameable for employing dishonest
servants or for a want of supervision (aliquatenus culpae reus est
quod opera malorum hominum uteretur, Inst. 4, 5, 3). There seems,
then, to be no reason for retaining in a rational system of juris-
prudence the class of obligations quasi ex delicto. The class of
obligations quasi ex contractu is not so easy to suppress-

All quasi delicts are suable by actio iu factum.

In actions on Delict, as opposed to Real actions and actions on
Contract, the liability of a defendant necessarily implies that he is
convicted either of Dolus or of Culpa, unlawsul intention or unlawful
negligence, 3 ξ 211: there is no liability for damnum absque in-
juria.

Τ110 opposite of Negligence is Diligenee, vigilance, attention,
which, like Negligence, admits of 311 infinite variety of grada-
tions. “

Actions under the lex Aquilia, instituted to recover penalties for
unlawful damage, have this peculiarity that, when Culpa is once
