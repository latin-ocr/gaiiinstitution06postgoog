difficulty in perceiving that real actions and actions on contract
belong to the former class (rei persecutio); and that of actions on
delict, a subdivision, which may be called V indictive (quae ad
ultionem pertinent, quae vindict-am continent), such as the actio
injuriarum, belong to the latter (poenae persecutio). The effect of
the former is restoration: they leave the plaintiff no richer and the
defendant no poorer in respect of property than he was at first3
whereas the vindictive actions leave the plaintiff, in respect of pro·
perty, richer, and the defendant poorer. But the remaining division
of actions on delict, those brought to recover indemnification sor

damage to property, are more ambiguous in character. If we
merely reg-ard their effect on the plaintiff they seem to be purely

reparativo, for they leave the plaintiff no richer3 but if we regard
their effect on the defendant they seem to be penal, for if the wrong
done by the defendant was a destruction of property, compensation.
to the plaintiff will leave the defendant poorer.

We have seen, 3 ᾧ 212, that, even under a contract, indemnification
included indirect losses or the. mediate value of the primary right,

.. ιι and might amount to twice the immediate value of the primary

right: and that, founded on delict, indemnification was not re-
stricted to any maximum.

Accordingly, with respect to these semi-penal [unilaterally penal]
actionS, the language of the Roman jurists varieS, they are sometimes

regarded as rci persecutiO, and sometimes as poenae persecuti03 but
the latter view predominated, and they have the principal incidente
of penal actions: they are only maintainable within a year, and are

¹ 1 · not passively transmissible, i. e. maintainable against the successor of

the defendant except so far as restorative, i. e. so far as the successor
was enriched‚ unless the suit was commenced (lis contestata) against
the original wrong-doer, in which case the penal obligation is
novated, 3 ᾗ 180, and becomes passively transmissible. These in-
cidents are resumed in the following passage of the Digest: Si
possessionis causa deterior facta esse dicetur dolo ejus qui in
possessionem missus sit, actio in eum ex dolo datur, quae neque
post annum neque in heredes ceterosque successores dabitur, quum
ex delicto oriatur poenaeque nomine concipiatur, nisi quatenus ad
eos pervenit 3 heredi autem dabitur quia et rei continet persecu-
tionem, Dig. 42, 5, 11. ‘If the possession is deteriorated by the
fraud of the person sent to seize the estate of the judgment debtor‚
an action of Fraud is maintainable against him, but not after a
