bines the characters of bonitary and
quiritary owner, she becomes a Latin,

he becomes both her successor and
her guardian.

DE cnsslcu TUTELA.

§lea Agnatis, qui legitimi tu-
tores mmmmm manumissoribus per-
-missum est fem-inarum tutelam alii

in iure meffqffl'ffl pupi rum autem*

tutelam non est permissum cedere,
quia..n videtur..osa, cum tem-
pore pubertatis finiatur.

§ 169. Is autem cui ceditur tutela
cessicius tutor vocatur.

ξ 170. Quo mortuo aut capite
diminuto revertitur ad eum tutorem
tutela qui cessit. ipse quoque qui
cessit, si mortuus aut capite dimi-
nutus sit, a cessicz'o tutela discedit
et revertitur ad eum, qui post eum
qui cesserat secundum gradum in
tutela habuerit.

ξ 171. Set quantum ad agnatos
pertinet, nihil hoc tempore de cessi-
cia tutela quaeritur, cum agnatorum

tutelae in feminis lege Claudia sub-
latae sint

ξ 172. Sed fiduciarios quoque
quidam putaverunt cedendae tutelae
ius non habere, cum ipsi se oneri
subiecerint. quod etsi placeat, in
parente tamen qui filiam neptemve
aut proneptem alteri ea lege man-
cipio dedit, ut sibi remanciparetur,
remancipatamque manumisit, idem
dici non debet, cum is et legitimus
tutor habeatur3 et non minus huic

qnam patronis honor praestandus
est„

ξ 168. Statutory guardians, whe-
ther agnates or patrous, are per-
mitted to transfer the guardianship
of a female ward by surrender be-
fore a magistrate; the guardianship
of a male ward is not allowed to be
transferred, because it is not con-
sidered onerous, being terminated
by the ward’s attaining the age of
puberty.

ξ 169. The surrenderee of a
guardianship is called a cessionary
guardian.

ᾗ 170. On his death or loss of
status the guardianship reverts to
the surrenderor‚ and on the surren-
deror’s death or loss of status it is
devested from the cessionary and
devolves on the person next entitled
after the surrenderor.

ξ 171. As far, however, as ag-
nates are concerned‚ in the present
day there is no such thing as ces-
sionary guardianship‚ for agnatio
guardianship over female wards was
abolished by the lex Claudia.

ξ 172. Fiduciary guardians, ac·
cording to some, are also disabled
from transferring their guardian·
ship, having voluntarily undertaken
the burden3 but although this is
the better opinion, yet a parent who
has mancipated a daughter, grand-
daughter, or great—granddaughter,
with a condition of remancipation to
himself, and manumittcd her after
remancipatiom should be excepted
from the rule, for he is ranked with
statutory guardians, and has the
same privilege as the patron of a
manumitted slave.
