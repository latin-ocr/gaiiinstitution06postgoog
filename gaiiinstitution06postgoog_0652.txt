630 DE ACTIONIBUS. [nr. ξς 138-170.

quo de agitur majore parte hujusce anni fuit, quominus is eum
ducat, vim fieri veto, Dig. 43, 31. ‘ VVhichever party had posses-
sion of the slave in question during th'e greater part of the pre-
ceding year, the violent hindrance of his prehension and abduction
of the slave I prohibit? The same exceptione of violence, clandes-
tinity, and permission, as in the interdict Uti possidetis, were either
expressed or understood. Before J ustinian’s time Utrubi had been
assimilated to Uti possidetiS, that is, comparative length of posses·
sion within the year was made immaterial. Hodie tamen aliter
observatur: nam utriusque interdicti potestas, quantum ad posses-
sionem pertinet, exaequata est, ut ille vincat et in re soli et in re
mobili qui possessionem nec vi nec clam nec precario ab adversario
litis contestationis tempore detinet, Inst. 4, 15, 4. ‘The modern
terms are different ; both interdictS‚ so far as possession is a title to
redreSS, are assimilated3 and in respect both of movables and of
immovables judgment goes for him who proves unimpeachable pos-
session at the moment of commencing the action.’

Utrubi and Uti possidetis are classed by Gaius under the head
of interdicta Retinendae possessionis. This was their category
when either party succeeded in proving an unimpeachable posses-
sion: but the exceptionS, vi clam aut precario, when sustained by
the non-possessor, brought Utrubi and Uti possidetis under the
category of interdicts Recuperandae possessionis, If, that is to say,
a litigant proved that he had actual possession, but his possession
was shown to be vitiated by violence, secrecy, or permission, he was
dispossessed and his opponent was reinstated in possession, Dig.
43, 17, 3, pr. Utrubi ‘was clearly a recuperator-y interdict in its

original form: but it was so equally, in virtue of the exceptions‚ after
its form had been assimilated to that of Uti possidetis. Baron,§ 120.

ᾧ 154. The interdict Unde vi (or De vi) had two forms, one of
which is called by Cicero interdictum quotidianum, and redressed

cases of ordinary violence (vis quotidiana), while the other was
invoked in cases of armed violence (vis armata).

The former has been thus restored by Keller from indications in
Cicero, Pro Caecina and Pro Tullio: Unde tu Numeri Negidi aut
familia· aut procurator tuus Aulum Agerium aut familiam aut pro-
curatorem illius in hoc anno vi dejecisti, qua de re agitur, cum ille
possideret, quod nec vi nec clam nec precario a te possideret, eo
restituas. ‘ In the place whence thou, Numerius Negidius, thy slaves
or procurator, hast this year violently ousted Aulus Agerius, his
