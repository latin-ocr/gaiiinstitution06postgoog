emancipated children, ᾧ 26, 011 condition that the latter brought
their goods into hotchpot (collatio bonorum), Dig. 37, 6. Children
given in adoption were not admitted 111 this order, but 111 the third
order of cognatos, ᾗ 31.

(2) Statutory heirs (legitimi), i. e. all who were entitled to in·

herit under any statute 3 e. g. agnates who were entitled under the .

Twelve Tables3 mothers, who were entitled to succeed their children
under the Sc. Tertullianum3 children, who were entitled to succeed
their mothers under the Sc. Orphitianum,- and sui heredes who had
repudiated or omitted to demand possession as members of the first
order within the interval allowed, namely‚ a year.

(3) Next of kin (proximi cognati) including those who had
neglected to claim in the first or second order.

(4) Husband and wife, when the wife is not in manu. A wife
in manu would be quasi daughter and therefore sua heres and
entitled to succeed with liberi in the first order.

These various grades of title are called unde liberi, unde legitimi,
unde cognati, unde vir et uxor, phrases which properly denote those
articles of the edict in which these classes are summoned to the
succession: ea pars edicti unde liberi vocantur, 810„ but are used
by Roman lawyers as epithets of intestato bonorum possessio.

'l'he degrees of cognation in a direct line are the number of
generations that separate a descendant from an ascendant: to
compute the degrees of collateral cognation we must add the degrees
of direct cognation. Thus a man is 0110 degree from his father,
81111 therefore two from his brother and three from his nephew.
He is two degrees from his grandfather, and therefore three from
his uncle and four from his first cousin or cousin german (con-
sobrinus). He is three degrees from his great-grandfather, and
therefore four from his great-uncle and five from his great-uncle’s
son (propior sobrino) 81111 six from his second cousin (sobrinus), that
is, his great-uncle’s grandson, for second cousins are the children ,
of first cousins. He is seven degrees from 1118 80001111 cousin's
children, and this is the only case in which the seventh degree
of cognation was recognized as giving a title to succeed in in-
testacy, the law only recognizing in other lines the sixth degree of
cognation. In English law collateral relationship is a title to
inheritance or succession without any limit-

was required to addrcss a formal demand to the magistrate: but
