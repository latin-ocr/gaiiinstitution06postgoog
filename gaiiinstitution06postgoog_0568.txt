the loss that his exorbitant claim had caused to the debtor, par-
ticularly in respect of the sees (sportulae) of the executive officere
(executores), Cod. 3, 10, 2. See p. 579.

ᾧ 55. Α plaintiff who had made a mistake in the subject of his
claim was allowed ΒΥ J ustinian to amend his claim without insti-
tuting a new action.

It seems from this paragraph that the title or ground of action
(causa debendi) e. g. testamentum, stipulatio, was sometimes specified
in the Intenti0. Perhaps this was done in Condictio certi, which
had no Demonstratio‚ and then availed to prevent the consumption
of the right of action3 that is, the allegation of the plea of Res
judicata when the plaintiff afterwards claimed the same sum but
founded his claim on a different title. ·

ᾧ 56. Α plaintiff whose intentio claimed less than he was entitled
to was allowed ΒΥ Zeno to obtain the full amount without institut-
ing' a new action, Inst. 4, 6, 34.

§ 60. It appears that some jurist had regarded the fimt clause of
an actio in factum, si paret . . . fecisse, as a demonstratio. Gaius
himself, in speaking of this clause used ambiguous terme, nominato
eo quod factum est, ᾧ 46. But it is clear from ᾧ 60 that he holds
it to be no Demonstratio, but an Intentio.

'Phe plaintiff who lost an actio in factum did not strictly speaking
lose his right to bring another action, for novatio, or transformation
of his original right into a right to have judgment, was only
operated ΒΥ the commencement of a personal action in jus. But
this made no practical different-e, for though his own right (ipsum
jus) was not extinguished, it was counterpoised by an opposite right
of the defendant based on the result of the trial (exceptio rei judi-
catae), which would cause any suit instituted by the plaintiff to be
dismissed.
