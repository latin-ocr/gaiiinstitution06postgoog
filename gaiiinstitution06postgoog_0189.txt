11. ξς 1-14.] SERVITUDE. 16⁷

right of forbidding a neighbour to raise the height of his buildings3
jus ne prospectui officiatur, the right of having a prospect un-
interoepted3 jus ne luminibus officiatur, the right of having the
access of light to one’s windows unobstructed3 jus stillicidii non
avertendi, the reacquired right of prohibiting my neighbour from
discharging his rainfall into my area.

Personal servitudes are rights of a less limited character: in-
stances are HabitatiO, the right of occupying a house, Usus, the
right of using a thing and consuming its immediate fruits or
products, without the right of letting the thing or selling its pro-
ductas, of acquiring, in other words, its rent and profits, which
may be regarded as its mediate or secondary fruits. Fructus,
usually called Ususfructus‚ the further right of leasing the thing
and selling its fruits. Habitat-io, Usus, Ususfructus were usually
estates for life, and, uulike real servitudes, implied Detention of
the subject3 Possession of the subject, as opposed to Detention,
remaining in the proprietor. Moreover, any of the powers which
usually and regularly compose Real servitudes may be conferred
in the form of Personal servitudes‚ which are then called by modern
jurists servitutes personales Irregulares.

For pignus, see 3 ξ 90, commentary.

superficies is the right of a person who has bought a house
without the ground on which it stands, or who has built a house
on another's ground with his permission‚ a house, that is, which at
⁴gentile law, by the rule of Accessiom is the property of the pro-
prietor of the soil. The Praetor, however, recognized in the super-
ficiarius a jus in re which he protected by an interdict de superficie
and an actio in rem utilis.

For emphyteusis, see 3 ξ 145. Although an emphyteusis might
be of unlimited duration, and was alienable without the consent of
the proprietor, yet the proprietor had a reversion on failure of the
heirs of the emphyteuta, just as the feudal lord of a fee has the
reversion on failure of the heirs of the tenant in fee. Accordingly,
emphyteusis is regarded as the model on which feudal tenure was
instituted. This reversion or escheat to the lord of the fee makes
property inland theoretically imperfect, and, like emphyteusiS, rather
a jus in re aliena than plenary dominion. Property in chatteIS, on
the contrary, has no reversioner interposed between the proprietot
and the sovereign as ultimus heres, and, therefore, is absolute.
