ιν. §5 115-13⁷.] EXTINO'HON. 601

down a rule that originally valid dispositione, if followed by a
change of circumstances to a state in which such a disposition
could not have had a valid inception‚ are thereby invalidated:
Etiam ea quae recte constiterunt, resolvi putant, cum in eum
casum reciderunt, a quo non potuissent consistere, Dig. 45, 1, 98,
pr. E. g. a marriage was dissolved when one of the parties subse· ζ
quently lost civitas or libertas. But there are exceptions to the ¹
rule: Non est novum ut quae semel utiliter constituta sunt, durent,
licet ille casus extiterit, a quo initium capere non potuerunt, Dig.
45, 1,.14o‚ 2. Exstingui obligationem, si in eum casum inciderit,
a quo incipere non potest, non . . . in omnibus verum est, Inst. 2,
20, 14. Ε. g. marriage is not dissolved by the lunacy of one of the
parties. Similarly a testament loses its validity when a testator
loses civitas or libertas, but not when he becomes a lunatic. It
seems then that no general rule can be applied.

A change in the opposite direction, i. e. from circumstances in-
consistent, to circumstances consistent, with a disposition, will not,
as a general rule, validate the disposition, or produce what is called
convalescence: Quod initio vitiosum est, non potest tractu tem-
poris convalescere, Dig. 50, 17, 29. Omnia, quae ex testamento
proficiscuntur, ita statum eventus capiunt, si initium quoque sine
vitio ceperint, Dig. 50, 17, 201. Regula Catoniana sic definit,
quod, si testamenti facti tempore decessisset testator, inutile foret,
id legatum, quandocunque decesserit, non valere, Dig. 34, ¹7, 1, pr.
But though this applied to legacies, it was not true of institutions ,
of a successor (hereditas), ib. 3, nor of all other dispositions. E. g.
when a non· -proprietor alienes and subsequently becomes proprietor‚
the alienation‚ originally invalid, convalesces, and the purchaser 1-
becomes proprietor without a new tradition, Dig. 41, 3, 42.

The removal of an exception, e. g. the voluntary ratification of a
conti-act that was originally vitiated by force or fraud, has prac-
tically the same effecte as convalescence3 but cannot properly be
called convalescence, because here the disposition is not originally
null and void, but only liable to counteraction. Accordingly in
such a case the plaintifl’s right would require to be enforced by
ReplicatiO.

3. Exceptions or counteractive pleas, which are the defendant's
third means of defence, are either based on the substantive code or
on the code of procedure.

(a) Examples of exceptions based on the code of procedure are:
