the juxta-tabular possession. J ustinian allowed him to take the
legal estate, Inst. 3, 9, pr.
ξ 132. To the necessity of leaving some legacy to the dis·

inherited asterborn sua heres (and not, as Blackstone suggests, ·

to the querela inofficiosi) we must attribute the vulgar error in
England of the necessity of leaving the heir one shilling in
order to cut him off effectually. The querela inofficiosi was not
barred by any legacy, however slight, being left to the heir,
but only by giving him one fourth of his intestate portion.
See 2 ξ 151. It seems that even a legacy left to an afterborn
sua heres might be unavailing to save the will from avoidance‚
unless it amounted to one fourth of her share by descent. If
no legacy at all were left, the will would be infor-mal from want
of proper disinheritance of the sua heres, and absolutely void ς
if less than a fourth of her share were lest, the will would not
be absolutely void but voidable, i. e. liable to be overthrown if
the aggrieved party chose to impeach it as inofficiosum.

ξ 135 α. The Praeteritio of a descendant who is suus heres to
the testator or, but for emancipation, would be suus heres, en-
titles the descendant to contra-tabulam· possession. If the praeteritus
is suus heres, the will is absolutely void and contra-tabular posses-
sion is an intestato succession: but if the praeteritus is emanci-
patus, the effect of contra-tabular possession is to divide the
inheritance between the praeteritus and other descendants who
were instituted successors, excluding both instituted strangers and
disinherited descendants.

Contra-tabular possession might be claimed either by the prae-
teritus himself, or by any of the instituted descendants. For if an
instituted heir took less ΒΥ his institution than he would by this
partial intestacy, it would be his interest to claim contra-tabular-
possession, commisso per alium edicto, ‘ the edict having been
made applicable by another,’ i. e. by the pretermission of another
descendant.

The portions of the will that remained in force were: .
(1) The exheredations: for such of the liberi as were duly
disinherited continued, as was mentioned, excluded from the in·-

heritance:

(2) The pupillary substitutione, the nature of which will here-
aster, ξ 179, be explained:

(3) Legacies given to certain conjunctae personae, e. g. legacies
