on any difference of principle, the answer is, No: on none, at least,
that modern commentatore have succeeded in discovering: it was
merely a difference on a multitude of isolated points of detail. We
are told indeed that the founders were men of dissimilar characters
and intellectual dispositions: that Labeo was characterized by bold-
ness of logic and a spirit of innovation3 while Capito rested on
tradition and authority, and inclined to conservatism, Dig. 1, 2, 47 3
but it is altogether impossible to trace their opposing tendencies in
the writings of their successors: and we must suppose that the
intellectual impulse given ΒΥ Labeo was communicated to the fol-
lowers of both schools of jurisprudence. But though, as we have
stated, no difference of principle was involved, each school was
accustomed to follow its leaders with much servility3 and it is
quite an exception to find, on a certain question, Cassiae, a member
of the Sabinian school, following the opinion of Labe03 while Pro-
culus, who gave his name to Labeo's school, preferred the opinion
of Ofilius, the teacher of Capito, 3 ᾧ 140.

We may briefly mention some of the most illustrious jurists who
flourished subsequently to the era of Gaius. Aemilius Papinianus
flourished under Marcus Aurelius and Septimius Severus, and was
murdered ΒΥ the order of Caracalla: 595 extracts from his writings
are contained in the Digest. It was perhaps due to the transcend-
ent genius, or at least to the extraordinary reputation, of Papinian‚
which made him seem too great to be reckoned any man’s follower,
that we cease henccforth to hear of opposing schools of jurispru-
denee. Papinian appears to have been stationed at York‚ with
the fonction of praefectus praetoriO, so that England may claim
some slight connection with the brightest luminafy of Roman

law.

⁸ A disciple and colleague of Papinian was Domitius Ulpianus,
murdered by the praetorian soldiery, whose domination he resisted,
in the presence of the Emperor Alexander Severus ε 2462 fragments,
composing about a third of the whole Digest, are taken from his
writings. An epitome of his Liber Singularis Regularum is still
extant in a manuscript of the Vatican Library, and is the work
referred to when, without mentioning the Digest, we cite the
authority of Ulpian.

Another disciple and colleague of Papinian was Julius Paulus, of
whose writings 2080 fragments are preserved in the Digest, forming
about a sixth of its mass. An epitome of his treatise called Sen-
