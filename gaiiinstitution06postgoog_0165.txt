she must demand a guardian under
the lex Atilia or Titia, aud in com-
pliancc with the same laws she
must demand a guardian on the de-
cease of her patron without leaving
any son in the family.

ξ 196. For males the attainment
of the age of puberty is a release
from wardship. Puberty‚ accord-
ing to Sabinus and Cassius and the
other authorities of my school, de-
pende on physical development, that
is, on capacity of generation3 or in
case of impotence on the comple-
tion of [eighteen years, or] the age
which even in the latest constitu-
tions usually implies capacity of
generation. The other school hold
that puberty is to be exclusively
measured by age, that is to say,
that it should always be deemed to
be attained on the completion by a
male of his fourteenth year.

ξ 196. All jurists agreed that in the case of the spado (natural
impotence) some fixed date must be assumed as the conventional
period of puberty. The Sabinian rule appears to be preserved in a
passage of Paulus: Spadones eo tempore testamentum faeere pos-
sunt quo plerique pubescunt, id est, anno decimo octavo, 3, 4 a, 2.

‘In cases of natural impotence testamentary capacity is acquired at
the age which almost always (even in the tardiest developments)
marks generative capacity, namely‚ eighteen years completedl'
Fourteen was assumed to be the average age of puberty3 but it
was too early, even in the southern elimes subject to Roman legis-
lation, for a minority of constitutions which advance more slowly
to maturity. Eighteen was supposed to be sufficiently postponed
to include most of these cases of retarded development. We have
already, in treating of adrogation, ξ 106, commentary, met with
the phrase, plena pubertas, denoting eighteen years of age. We
may suspect that in Paulus we should read, quo plerique pubescunt
qui tardius pubescunt3 and in Gaius, nujus aetatis puberes fiunt
qui tardius puberes fiunt3 the similarity of ending having caused
the omission of the clauses by the transcribere.

schools among the Roman juris auctores, to which we shall find
