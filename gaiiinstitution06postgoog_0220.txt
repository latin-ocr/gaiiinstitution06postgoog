ξ 65. Ergo ex his quae diximus
adparet quaedam naturali iure alie-
nari, qualia sunt ea quae traditione
alienantur3 quaedam ciuili, nam
mancipationis et in iure cessionis
et usucapionis ius proprium est
civium Romanorum.

ξ 66. Nec tamen ea tantum quae
traditione nostra fiunt naturali no-
bis ratione adquiruntur, sed etiam
quae occupando ideo adqui-sistimus,
quia antea nullius essent z qualia
sunt omnia quae terra, mari, coelo
capiuntur.

ξ 67. Itaque si feram bestiam aut
volucrem aut piscem ceperimus,
quidquid ita captum fierit, id eta-
tim nostrumfit, et eo usque nostrum
esse intellegitur, donec nostra cus-
todia coerceatur. cum vero eusto-
diam nostram evaserit et in natura-
lem libertatem se receperit, rursus
occupantis fit, quia nostrum esse
desinit. naturalem autem libertatem
recipere videtur, cum aut oculos nos-
tros evaserit, aut licet in conspectu
sit nostro, difficilis tamensim rei
persecutio sit.

§68. In iis autem animalibus
quae ex consuetudine abire et redire
solent, veluti columbis et apibus,
item cervis qui in silvas ire et
redire solent, talem habemus regu-
lam traditam, ut si revertendi ani-
mum habere desierint, etiam nostra
esse desinant et fiant occupantium.
revertendi autem animum videntur
desinere habere, cum revertendi
consuetudinem deseruerint. ,

ξ 65. Thus it appears that some
modes of alienation are titles of
natural law, as delivery of posses-
sion, and others of civil law, as
mancipation, surrender‚ usucapion,
for these are titles conflned to
citizens of Rome.

§66. Another title of natural
law, besides Tradition, is Occupa-
tion, whereby things not already
subjecte of property become the
property of the first occupant, as
the wild inhabitants of earth, air,
and water, as soon as they are
captured.

ξ 67. For wild beastS, birds,
and fishes, as soon as they are cap-
tured, become, by natural law, the
property of the captor, but only
continue such so long as they con-
tinue in his power 3 after breaking
from his custody and recovering
their natural liberty, they may be·
come the property of the next occu-
pant; for the ownership of the first
captor is terminated. Their natural
liberty is deemed to be recovered
when they have escaped from his
sight, or, though they continue in
his sight, when they are difficult to
recapture.

-- ξ 68. In those wild animals, how-
ever, which are habituated to go
away and return, as Ρίςθοηε, and
beeS, and deer, which habitually
visit the foreste and return, the rule
has been handed down, that only
the cessation of the instinct of re-
turning is the termination of owner-
ship, and then the property in them
