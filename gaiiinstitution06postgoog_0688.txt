Formal dispositione. ’ ᾗ

'Phe FORMAL dispositione of Roman jurisprudence were frequently
smumnvn. When a new juristic purpose was to be accomplished‚
the method of jurisprudence was, instead of creating for it by an
effert of imagination a new corporeal form, to lay hold of some
existing disposition, an'd wrenching it more or less completely from
its original basis and original uses, to employ its more or less
twisted and distorted form as a vehicle or incorporation of the new
intention. The new intention is the reality: the original intention
is divorced from the form once its own, and now is merely suns-
12ATED. Thus J udicial surrender (in jure cessio) is intended to effect
a transmutation of ownership from person to person: in form it is
a judgment respecting an already existent ownership. Nexum
and Expensilatio were intended to operate novatione, to transform
equitable into legal obligation: in form they both were loans of
money. Mancipation a solemn form of conveying· dominion simu-
lated a sale and the accompaniment of primeval sales, the weighing
of the uncoined masses of bronze that served as purchase money.
The form then, instead of being· the natural execution and expres-
sion of an intention, has but a remote correspondence to the end
which it embodies‚ and sometimes may be called simeone: e.g.
the productiori of the scales and bars of bronze and pantomime of
weighing in Mancipation was the natural mode of executing an
archaic sale, but is merely 8 sumone or hieroglyphic expression of
the transmutation of dominion. Sometimes a mimetie disposition
became itself the object of subsequent mimicry. Thus while
Mancipation was a fictitious sale (imaginaria venditiO, 1 ᾗ 113),
Testament was a fictitious Mancipation (imaginaria mancipati0‚ y
Ulpian 20, 2), i.e. the simulation of a simulation.

The Simulative character was not a universal feature even of the
older Forma] dispositione: for instance, Stipulation seems to have
had nothing mimetic in its form: while later jurisprudence‚ when
it had to invent a form, never adopted the symbolic style. Rigo-
rous forms were prescribed 83 8 condition of the validity of various
dispositione z e. g. the presence of a certain number of witnesses for
the execution of a Will ε declaration before a notary for a guaranty
by a woman: memorandum in the official records of a magistrate
(actis, gestis insinuare) for donatione of more than 500 solidi: none
of which were simulatione of any more primitive procedure.
