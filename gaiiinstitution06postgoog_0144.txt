occurs when lands descend upon a minor, and devolves by the
Common law upon those of his next of blood upon whom the
inheritance cannot descend. Thus, if the lands descend to the
heir from the paternal line, the mother or other nearest maternal
relative shall have the guardianship3 and vice-versa, the father or
other nearest· paternal relative, if the lands descend from the
maternal line. While recognizing that proximity of blood is a

. natural recommendation to this office, the Feudal law judges it

improper to trust the person of the infant into the hands of 6
possible heir, for fear he should be tempted to abuse 1116 trust.
The law of Scotland and the ancient law of France took a middle
course, and committed the pupil’s estate to the person entitled
to the legal successim, because he is most interested in preserving
it from waste, but excluded him from the custody of the pupil’s
person, because his interest is placed in opposition to the life of
the pupil. Coke 61111 Blackstone triumph in the superior wisdom
of the Common law compared with the Roman law. Kent, the
American jurist‚ is inclined to believe that the English, the Scotch,
and the French law equally proceed on too great a distrust of the
ordinary integrity of mankind. It is, however, noteworthy that the
sears and precautions of Feudal law, though not imitated by the
Roman legislator, were paralleled by Roman testators when they made
a substitution, that is, 6 devise to a second successor, in the event
of the first successor dying before attaining to years of puberty
(pupillaris substitutio), 2 ξ 181. It is perhaps less remarkable
that 6 legislator should seek by a general rule to guard against
occasional depravity, than that a testator, exercising 611 individual

ᾧ 158. Τ116 maxim here enunciated is calculated to give a false
idea of the relation of the institutes of Gentile law to those of civil
law. Title by cognation is just as much an institute of Positive
law as title by agnation. The synthesis of title and right in Civil
law may be freakish and capricious, while that in Gentile law is
reasonable and expedient3 but both are equally positive institutione,
and both are equally mutable and 1161116 to be overruled. Accord-
ingly, the specious-sounding maxim, that revolutions in status or
civil condition cannot affect such rights as are annexed to natural
titles, crumbles away as soon 66 we examine it, for we find that it
only holds good of the most insignificant change, the minima
