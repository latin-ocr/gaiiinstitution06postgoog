prominent and 6011616111 object of the J 111161 than the corresponding
primary rights. Thus the portion of primary rights that here-
after, as opposed to Acquired rights, we shall 6611 Primordial
rights (right to life, health, liberty, reputation, etc.) are never 60

division 11110 Real and Personal, or jus in rem and jus in personam.
This division of rights depende on a, division of the corresponding
obligations. Every right residing in one person implies the
existence of another person or persons on whom a corresponding
duty is incumbent. The corresponding duty is sometimes incum-
bent on a determinate person or persons, sometimes on persons
indeterminate, in other words, on the world at large. In the
former case it is usually positive, 'that 16 10 say, a duty of actual
performance3 in the latter case it is usually negative, that is 10
say, a duty of abstention or forbearance. Jus in personam is a
right to acts on the part of a certain person, J us in rem is a right

right are Status, Franchise, Ownership: examples of Personal
