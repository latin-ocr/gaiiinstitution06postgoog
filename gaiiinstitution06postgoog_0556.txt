object was enforced by J usjurandum in litem, an institution that

will be presently explained.
As soon as the rule was established: OQqudiOia esse absolutoria,

ξ 114, that in every action a defendant might avoid condemnation
by satisfying the plaintiff's claim even after the commencement of

the suit, it might seem that the formula arbitraria was rendered
unnecessary. But this was not so; for whereas in other actious
the defendant might hope for a judgment in his favour, in actio
arbitraria as soon as the arbitratus or order was pronounced he
would know that he would inevitably be condemned unless he made
the restitutio or exhibitio required. 'Phe formula arbitraria would,
however, become in most cases unnecessary in the last period of
Roman lawwhen, as we shall presently see, the defendant was not
invite-d under pain of heavy damages, but compelled by the public
force (manu militari), to make specific restitution.

The intentio of an action with a formula in factum concepta was
sometimes one-limbed3 e. g. S‘i paret . . . . vocatum esse, ᾧ 46, and
sometimes two-limbed: e. g. Si paret (1) Aulum Agerium rem de-
posuisse (2) eamque dolo malo Numerii Negidii Aulo Agerio
redditam non esse. A one-limbed intentio would be used when the
defence was a simple traverse or contradiction of the fact alleged by
the plaintiff : a two-limbed formula would be used when the de-
fendant confessed the fact alleged by the plaintiff but alleged a
second fact (payment, release, novation, Sto.) whereby the obligation
created by the former was extinguished or counteracted.

Accordingly it would be a mistake to suppose that the clause:
eamque dolo malo Numerii Negidii Aulo Agerio redditam non esse
was equivalent to the arbitratus or clause Ni restituat which in the
preceding formula limits the condemnatio, The former clause raises
the question whether restitution was made before the action was
brought (ante judicium acceptu m): the clause Ni restituat gives
the defendant power to make restitution at any time aster the
action was brought but before the condemnatio: and there is no
reason why the clause Ni restituat should not be added to the
double-limbed as well as to· the single-limbed formula in factum
concepta or the formula in jus concepta.

§425 From the expression of GaiuS, non ipsam rem condemnat
sicut olim fieri solebat, we might suppose that statute-process (legis
actio) differed from Formulary procedure in that, while in the latter
the condemnation was always pecuniary, in the former, as in the
