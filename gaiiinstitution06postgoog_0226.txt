In one case the operation, even of contract and delivery combined,
is limited by the Twelve Tables, namely, in Sale. Here it is pro-
vided that tradition shall not operate a transmutation of property
without a further condition—payment of the purchase money,
unless the sale is intended to be a sale on credit, Inst. 2, 1, 41.

Tradition in Roman law was never fictitious; it was always an
actual delivery of a power of physical or corporeal control. In
English law, indeed, conveyance by a deed under the Statute of
Uses is said to transfer possession 3 but this is impossible: the
physical fact of possession can no more be produced by writing on a
parchment, than ignition, or explosion, or chemical decomposition
can be produced by writing on a parchment, or by any other than
its appropriate antecedent. The possession conveyed by assurance
under the Statute of Uses is merely a fictitious possession3 and
instead of saying that the deed pasees possession, it would be nearer
the truth to say that, in respect of a conveyance under the Statute
of Uses, all those parts of the law are deemed to be expunged
which make the rights and duties of the alienee dependent on
possession. By this statute property in land, which before could
only be transferred by tradition (livery of seisin), became transfer-
able by a mere translative contract (bargain and sale).

Although we have not yet arrived at the subject of Obligation,
we may here by way of anticipation observe that in dispositions
creating a jus in personam Traditio plays a no less important part
than in dispositions creating a jus in rem, as we shall see when we
have to deal with contracts Real innominate. In these contracts
Traditio, superseding Stipulation and other symbolic Forms, is the
clement which differentiates a pactum nudum from a pactum ves·
titum, i. e. which makes a convention enforcible by the public
tribunals. For the present it may suffice to quote the words of
Gaius as given in the Digest: In traditionibus rerum quodcunque
pactum sit id valere manifestissimum est, D. 2, 14, 48. ‘The
conventions that accompany a delivery of possession are certainly
valid.'

For a further examination of the nature of Possession, see the
theory of the possessor-y interdicte, Book 4.

has no proprietor. Quod enim ante nullius est, id naturali ratione

owner, it is only after dereliction by him that it can be appropriated
