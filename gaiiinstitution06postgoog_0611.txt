1v. ξ 114.] OMNIA IUDICIA ABSOLUTORIA. 589

The executore of a testator and administratore osan intestate have
the same remedy for injury to the personal property of the deceased
as he would have had in his lifetime.

For an injury committed against his real property within six
months of his death, they may bring an action within one year after
his death. And for an injury to either real or personal property
committed within six months before the death of the wrong-doer,
an action may be brought against his executore or administratore
within six months after they have taken on themselves adminis-
tration.

if the defendunt before judgment is
pronouuced, but after the formula
is delivered, satisfies the plaintiff,
the judex has power to absolve him,
or must condemn him, because he
was liable to condem·.ation when
the formula was delixered. The·
authorities of my school hold that
he should be absolved in every
kind of action3 and hence the say-
ing that Sabinus and-Cassius con·
sider all actions to involve the
power of absolution. The other
school agree in respect of bona fide
actions, where the judex has more

ᾧ 114. Respecting the power of absolution, J ustinian confirmed
the opinion of the Sabinianus, Inst. 4, 12, 2.

The principle, Omnia judicia esse absolutoria indicates an ex-
ception to the effecte of Litis contestatio. The motive of the effecte
ascribed to Litis contestatio is in general to avert from the plaintiff
the injurious consequences of the protracted duration of a trial.
Accordingly if judgment passed in his favour he was put into the
position he would have occupied if J udgment had immediately fol-
lowed on litis contestatio. If this rule had been universal no event
supervening on litis contestatio could have extinguished the plain-
tiff's right to have judgment in his favour: but this in some cases
