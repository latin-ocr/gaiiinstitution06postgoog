amount to an obstruction of prospect which does not cause a
diminution of light, D. 8, 2, 15; but is wider than servitus altius
non tollendi, because light may be intercepted by other causes than
buildings, by plantation, for instance, though building is the prin-
cipal means of interception, D. 8, 2, 4.

Another servitude relating to light has been the subject of much
controversy. Servitus luminum has been already noticed, p. 166, as
apparently identical with jus luminis immittendi, i. e. the right of
having a window in a neighbour's wall. Luminum servitute con-
stituta id adquisitum videtur ut vicinus lumina nostra excipiat,
D. 8, 2, 4. ‘The easement of Lights entitles the owner of the
dominant house to have a window in the wall of his servient neigh-
bour? Eos qui jus luminis immittendi non habuerunt aperto pariete
communi nullo jure fenestras immisisse respondi, D. 8, 3, 40. ⁶ With-
out an easement of immission of light a neighbour has no right to
make a window in a common wall.' As it is a law of easements
that nulli res sua servit, D. 8, 2, 27, a man cannot have an
easement over his own property3 and, inferentially, nulli res com-
munis servit, cannot have an easement over that of which he is
co-proprietor3 it follows that in the preceding passage the expres-
sion, a common wall, is used inaccurately to denote a wall of which
half the breadth belongs to one proprietor and half to another.

It appears from the above explanation that the servitus luminum
and the servitus ne luminibus officiatur belong to different categories,
for the servitus luminum, like the jus officiendi luminibuS, belongs
to the category of jus habendi3 while the servitus ne luminibus
officiatur belongs to the category of jus prohibendi.

ξ 34. 'Phe statement that an inheritance is not mancip-able
may seem inconsistent with what we are afterwards told of the
testament by bronze and balance, ᾇ 102. There ie, however,
no real inconsistency. The subject mancipated in the will ΒΥ
bronze and balance, though a universitas, was not an inherit-
ance—there was no inheritance to mancipate, for nemo est heres
viventis—but the collective rights—familia, patrimonium—of the
testator.
