the position of despotic sovereign. 'Phe relation of civis to pere-
grinus, so far as any rights at all were accorded to peregrinae, may
be conjectured to have originally been that of patronus to cliens,
that is to say, of political superior to political inferior.

Government or positive law has usually commenced in the in-
vasion by the stronger of the (moral) rights of the weaker3 but
so necessary is inequality to equality, or subordination to coordina-
tion, that the (moral) crimes of ancient conquerors are regarded
with less aversion by philosophie historiam, as being the indis-
pensable antecedente of subsequent civilization. The beginnings‚
then, of positive law have been universally the less legitimate form
of inequality, inequality between subject and subject, leaving its
traces in dispositione of the civil code: but the advance of civiliza-

ff· tion is the gradual elimination of inequality from the law, until

little remains but that between magistrate and private person, or
sovereigu and subject. Modern society has advanced so far on the
’ path of equalization, in the recognition of all men as equal before
the law, that the distinctions of status, as they existed in the
Roman law of persons, are almost obliterated from the private code.
Slavery has vanished3 parental and marital power are of the mildest
form3 civilized countries accord the same rights to cives and
peregrini ; guardians (tutores) in modern jurisprudence, as in the
later period of Roman law, are considered as discharging a public
function, and accordingly the relation of guardian and ward may
be regarded as a portion of the public code.

Having been led to mention Public or Constitutional law, it may
aid to clear our conceptions if we observe that some of its disposi-
tions are necessarily, and by the nature of the case, deficient in
the characters of Positive law. It is rigorously true to say that
the powers of subordinate political functionaries arg a status, They
imply rights and duties on the part of superior and inferior, enforced
by appeal to the common sovereign. But, when tracing the
hierarchy of government, we come to the top of the scale3 when
we speak of the limitatione of the sovereign power, we have passed
from the sphere of Positive law. 'Phe sovereign is free from the
fetters of positive law 3 he has no legal obligations, for they would
imply a superior. Like a private individual who sets an ethical

law to himself, the sovereign is not constrained to observe con· ⁴

stitutional law by aught that resembles a positive· sanction. The
existence of a law to bind the sovereign being assumed, the sove-
