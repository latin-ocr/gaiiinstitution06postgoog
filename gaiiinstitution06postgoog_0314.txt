with is changed. It was characteristic of jus in personam or
obligation (before, at least, the invention of papers payable to the
holder and transferable by delivery) that it was not capable of
a similar alienation. All that could be done to accomplish a similar
result was to employ one of two cumbrous processes, Novation or
Cession of Action (Procuration), 2 ᾦ 38. 111 111666 procedures there
is no Succession, for in Novation the transferree is not invested
with the same right that previously vested in the transferror, but
a new right is created in the transferree while the old right of the
transferi-or is extinguished: and in Procuration 01· Cession the right
still continues vested in the transferror, who allows the transferree
to recover it or enforce it by action and retain the fruits of the
recovery.

This inalienability of obligatione, however, was confined to
SINGULAR successione (in singularum rerum dominium successio).
UNIVERSAL succession (per universitatem successio) or the trans-
mission of the ideal whole ‘of a patrimony, of which we
have an example in hereditas testamentary or intestate, differed ι
from SINGULAR succession by the capacity of passing obligation
66 well as Dominion. The heres of the testator or intestate sued s
and was sued in his own name on· the obligations, active or pas-
sive, that originally vested in the deceased. But umvnnsn„
succession was an institution only recognised by Roman jurispru-
dence in certain definite cases. It was a formidable operation and
rigorously circumscribed. It was not a transaction that the law
allowed 10 be accomplished at the discretion of individual parties
in pursuance of private convention. It was only admitted in the
cases enumerated by Gaius, 2 ᾦ 98, and, without legislative inter-
ference, the list could not be augmented.

These difficulties in the transfer of obligation‘ opposed a great,
obstacle to the transfer (restitutio) of trust successions: and these
difficulties were partially removed by the Sc. Trebellianum and
Sc. Pegasianum, and more completely by J ustinian, by investing
the Restitutio with the character of successio per universitatem,
in other words, by the legislative sanction of a new instance of
nmvnnsm, succession. ⁷
