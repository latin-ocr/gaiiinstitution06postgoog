contract, but only a Verbal contract, and this without the inter-
vention of Novation, Dig. 46, 2, 6, 1, and Dig. 46, 2, 7. Nam
quoties, pecuniam mutuam dantes, eandem stipulamur, non duae
obligationes naseuntur sed una verborum, Dig. 45, 126, 2. ‘ An
advance accompanied by Stipulation does not produce two contracte,
but one, a Verbal contract.'

Savigny’s doctrine that personal execution (incarceration) of a
judgment debtor (judicatus) was confined to actions brought on
loans of money (annumeratio) accounts satisfactorily for a debt
being sometimes left in its original form of a Real contract
(mutuum), sometimes being conver-ted into a Verbal contract
(stipulatio), or Literal contract (expensilatio). When the interest
of the borrower prevailed, the contract would take the form of
stipulatio or expensilati0‚ with a milder remedy; when the interest
of the lender predominated, the contract would retain the form of
mutui datio, with its more stringent execution.

The exceptio doli mali or pecuniae non numeratae, throwing the
burden of proof on the promisee, as we have stated in respect of
verbal eontracts, would have destroyed the effect of literal contracta,
supposing that any such existed, for the five years or two years
during which the exceptio could be pleaded. 'I'he promisee
fulfilled his duty of Proof if he produced a written acknowledgment
by the promisor of the particular debt that preceded the promise
to pay (cautio discreta). Sin autem cautio indebite exposita. esse
dicatur, et indiscrete loquatur, tunc eum in quem cautio exposita est
compelli debitum esse ostendere quod in cautionem deduxit; nisi
ipse specialiter qui cautionem exposuit causas explanavit pro quibus
eandem conscripsit. 'runc enim stare eum oportet suae confessioni,
nisi evidentissimis probationibus in scriptis habitis ostendere paratus
sit, sese haec indebite promisisse, Dig. 22, 3, 25, 4, ‘ When a written
acknowledgment of debt is alleged to be without consideration, if
it does not specify the origin of the debt‚ the burden of proof is on
the promisee3 but if it speeify the cause of debt‚ the promisor
must stand by his admission, unless he has the clearest documentary
evidence to prove the failure of consideration. '

Cautio in J ustinian's legislation still, as originally, merely signi-
fied a probative or evidentiary document, as opposed to a literal
contract‚ and denoted the written memorandum which usually
accompanied every contract‚ whether real, verbal, or consensual.
It is often named, for instance, in connection with deposit‚ sale,
