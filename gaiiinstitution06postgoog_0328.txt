so he is before Litis contestatio, if taxable with Mora. In this
respect, then, Mora is more serious in its consequences than Mala
fides: for Mora in every case is a title to liability for casus 3 whereas
Mala fides only produces this liability iu conjunction with Litis
contestatio,

Mora had also an important influcnce in fixing the date of litis
aestimatio, i. e. the date for the valuation of the thing whose value
the defendant was condemned to pay. See 3 ᾧ 180 com. ; Saviguy,
§§ 264-277,

§283 Money paid by mistake was not recoverable when the
payor was liable to be sued for double damages, Inst. 3, 27, 7,
because then the payment is not deemed to be a mistake, but a com-
promise‚ in order to avoid the chance of condemnation in double
damage& The laws protecting certain rights by duplication of
damages, 4 ᾧ 171, would have been evaded if a defendant was allowed
to pay the simple damages and then attempt to recover them back
by condictio indebiti soluti.

to purchase land or to take land by devise. Land purchased ΒΥ an
alien or devised to an alien was forfeited to the crown. An alien,
however, could hold personal property and take bequests of personal

a will, but all his property at his death escheated to the crown
by the droit d'auba‘ine. [Aubain is from alibanus. Alibi in bar-

and ante antianus. Diez.]

ᾧ 289. J ustinian abolished the distinction between legacies and
trusts‚ enacting that legacies should no longer be governed ΒΥ the
rigours of the civil law, but subject to the same rules and construed
with the same liberality as trusts, Inst. 2, 20, 3. Tmsts being a
matter of the praetor's cognitio extraordinaria cannot, properly
speaking, be called a subject of Bonae fidei actiO, for actio implies
the cognizance of a judex: but the principles of cognitio extraor-
dinaria were doubtless the same as those of bonae fidei actio. With
this reservation, then, we may say that legata sinendi modo and per
damnationem were before J ustinian?s time recoverable b} stricti
juris acti0, and aster his time by bonae fidei acti0.

By English law, a will of lands operates as a mode of conveyance
requiring no extrinsic sanction to render it available as a document
of title. A will of personalty requires for its authentication to be
