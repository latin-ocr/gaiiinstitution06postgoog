mancipi quam nec mancipi mulie-
rilme et pupillis sino tutoris aucto-
ritate solvi possunt, quoniam me·
liorem condicionem suam facere' iis
etiam sine tutoris auctoritate con-
cessum est.

ξ 84. Itaque si debitor pecuniam
pupillo solvat, facit quidem pecu-
niam pupilli, sed ipse non libera-
tur, quia nullam obligationem pu·
pillus sine tutoris auctoritate dis-
solvere potest, quia nullius rei
alienatio ei sinc tutoris auctoritate
concessa cst. set tamen si ex ea
pecunia locupletior factus sit, et
adhuc petat, per exceptionem doli
mali summoveri potest.

ξ 85. Mulieri vero etiam sine
tutoris auctoritate recte solvi po-
test: nam qui solvit, liberatur obli-
gatione, quia res nec mancipi, ut
proxume diximus, a se dimittere
mulier et sine tutoris auctoritate
potest: quamquam hoc ita est, si
accipiat pecuniam5 at si non acci-
piat, sed habere se dicat, et per
acceptilationem velit debitorem sine
tutoris auctoritate liberare, non po-
test.

PUPILLORUM ALIENATIO.

cipable and non-mancipable things
can be conveyed to women and
warda without their guardian’s au-
thority, because they do not require
his authority to better their posi-
tion.

ξ 84. Accordingly, a debtor who
pays money to a ward pasees the
property therein to the ward, but
is not discharged of his obligation,
because a ward cannot release from
any liability without his guardian's
authority, as without such authority
he cannot aliene any right: if, how-
ever, he profits by the money, and
yet demands further payment, he
may be barred by plea of fraud.

ξ 85. A woman may be lawfully
paid without her guardian's author-
ity, and the payer is discharged of
liability, because, as we lately men-
tioned, a woman does notneed her
guardian’s authority for the alien-
ation of a non-mancipable right,
provided always that she receives
actual payment: for if she is not
actually paid, she cannot feign re-
ceipt and release her debtor by fic-
titious acknowledgment (3 § 169)
without her guardian's authority.

§82 For mutuum, see 3 ᾗ 90. If the money delivered by a ward
could be traced it was recoverable by real action (vindicatio): if it
had been consumed in bona fides a personal action, condictio certi,
would lie to recover an equive-lent sum ε if it had been consumed in
mala fides a personal action, ad exhibendum, would lie to recover
an equivalent sum and damages, Inst. 2, 8, 2.

ᾧ 85. The pupilage of women after attaining the age of twelve,
i. c. the age of puberty, had become obsolete before the time of
J nst-inian, and with it their incapacities of alienation.

not only by our own acts but also
by the acts of persons in our power,
hand, or mancipation; further, by
