casual destruction of the thing he has purchased, for this loss was
not occasioned by his minority or inexperience. Such abnormal
positione (justae causae) are compulsion, fraud, minority, absence,
error.

(3) A third· condition of relies is the absence of various disen-
titling circumstances, Thus relief is granted against the effect
of lawful omissions or dispositione, but not against the effect of
delicts3 at all events not of dolose or intentional delicte, but only
of culpose delicte, i. e. of torts committed from negligence. Again
the extraordinary relief of in integrum restitutio is not granted
when the courts of civil law can administer an adequate remedy.

Originally capitis minutio of a defendant was ground for a resti-
tution, 3 § 843 but this ceased at an early period to be a genuine
case of restitution3 for rescission of the adrogation, adoption, eman·
cipation‚ whereby a person’s debts were extinguished, was granted
as a matter of course without any previous investigation (causae
cognitio), and without any period of prescription like that which
limited the right to pray for restitution.

This waS‚ originally, annus utilis, and in the time of Justinian,
quadriennium continuum or 4 calendar years (3 ᾧ 117, commentary)‚
which begin to run, not from the date of the Laesion, but from
the termination of the Causa, i. e. the abnormal position—minority,
absence, compulsion, deception, error—whereby the Isaesion was
occasioned. Such at least is Savigny's opinion. Vangerow holds
that, except in Minority and Absence, prescription begins to run
from the date of Laesion, ᾧ 181.

Of the five titles to restitution that we have enumerated‚ four,
namely, intimidation, fraud, absence, error, implying equality of
rights in all parties, belong to the law of Things 3 title by minority,
implying a privileged class or inequality of rights, belongs to the
law of Persons.

As we shall have occasion in the next book to use the expression
Rerum universitaS, it may seem appropriate, before we quit the law
of Persons, to give some Explanation of the contrasted term, Per-
sonarum universitas. A University of persons in the private code is
a fictitious or juristic person, composed generally by the union of a
number of individuals, and capable like a natural individual (singu-
laris persona) of the various rights and ‹luties of property, that is
to say, of dominium, servitus, potestas, patronatus, colonatuS, obli-
gatio 3 and the power of suing and being sued.
