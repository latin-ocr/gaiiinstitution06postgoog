1v. ἕξ 115-137.] RES LITIGIOSA. 611

the sale is void and the purchaser forfeits fifty sestertia to the
treasury. The edict is inapplicable to provincial soil? Italic soil
was aliened ΒΥ manci patio, 2 §2⁷ ς and mancipation of land was
perfect without delivery of possession, 1 ᾗ 121. 'Phe edict only
declared the sale (emptio) void, not the mancipatio. To defeat, ’
therefore, the vindicatio of the purchaser, the possessor (defendant
in the original suit) required the protection of an exceptio.
Alienation ΒΥ a defendant in possession appears not to have been
prohibited, because, the condemnatio in any suit being pecuniaria,
it was held that the defendant could not injure the plaintiff by
alienation of the specific thing.

At a later period, when execution in a suit consisted in the
delivery of the specific thing, alienation ΒΥ a defendant was re-
cognised as an injury to the plaintiff. Accordingly J ustinian's
code, 8, 37, 2, not only avoided every alienation by a plaintiff of
the dominion or obligation that he claims‚ but also alienation by
a possessing defendant in a vindicatio, cod. 8, 37, 4, Nov. 112, 1.
If the purchaser had notice of the litigiosity, he forfeits the
purchase money to the fiscus, and the vendor forfeits an equal
sum. If the purchaser was without notice, he recovers his pur-
chase money and one-third additional from the vendor, who further
forfeits two-thirds to the treasury. Vangerow, ᾗ 160.

Compare the prohibition of Champerty and Maintenance in
English law. Champerty is buying or selling a disputed title to
land not in possession of the seller. Whether the title of the
vendor be bad or good, if the land is held adversely to him, such
a sale is void. Choses in possession (movables) and choses in
action (obligations) may be sold after the institution of a suit,
unless the assignment savour of Maintenance, i. e. be made with
the design of fomenting litigation.

ᾧ 120. J ustinian, Inst. 4, 13, 8, uses the term temporalis as equi-
valent to dilatoria, but then an ambiguity arises: for temporalis
exceptio sometimes denotes the plea of prescription (longi temporis
exceptio), e. g. cod. 5, 12, 30: and the plea of prescription is per·
petua, i. e. non-temporalis.

ᾧ 123. 'Phe statement of Gaius, that a dilatory exception, if sus-
tained, was fatal to the claim of the plaintiff, as his right of action
was consumed, can scarcely have been true of exceptio sori, and
exceptio praejudicialis. When a court is incompetent to try a cause
or postpones the trial, the instructions te the judge: Si non paret,
