sense, they were relieved by a branch of the praetor’s equitable
jurisdiction, called integri restitutiO, a power of cancellation and
rescission, in cases of manifest collision between law and equity.
This privilege of women was partiall y abrogated by a constitution
of the Emperor Le0, ΛΑ). 469: Ne passim liceat mulieribus omnes
suos contractus retractare, in his quae praetermiserint vel ignora-
verint: statuimus si per ignorantiam juris damnum aliquod circa
jus vel substantiam suam patiantur, in his tantum casibus in quibus
praeteritarum legum auctoritas eis suffragatur, subveniri, cod. l,
18, 13. ‘ Το prevent the indiscriminate revocation by women of all
their contracts on the ground of omission or error, be it enacted,
that ignorance of law, whereby a woman is damnified in her right
or property, shall only be a title to relief in those cases where
women have heretofore been expressly excepted from the provisions
of any statute.'

§ 195. There are various modes
by which a freedwoman may have
the other kinds of guardian: for
instance, on manumission by a
woman, when she must request a
guardian under the lex Atilia, or
in the provinces under the lex
Julia and Titia, as a female patron
cannot be guardian to a freedman
or freedwoman: also on manumis-

she makes a coemption, and then
is remancipated and manumitted,

guardian, and is replaced by the
second manumitter, who is called
a fiduciary guardian. Also on the
