possibly inadequate examination, as incidental or ancillary to the
decision 01 1116 161601 issue, the re-trial of the more important issue
would be barred by the exceptio rei judicatae.

Observe that the rule is, a judgment shall 601 116 contradicted
by a judgment in another action when the same right is in ques-
tion, not, when the same title is in question. The latter expression
would be sufficient 10 16661 1116 6666 01 personal actions. Here
every different obligation is ground to support a different 6611011,
6611 every different title engenders a different obligation. Thus a
plaintiff who fails in an 661106 011 1011 alleging Dolus is 1101 1116-
611111611 from 6 subsequent action on tort alleging Culpa, Dig.
40, 12, 13. Β111 1116 11116 60 6161611 would 1101 adequately meet the
6666 01 1661 actions. Here it is immaterial 11161 the plaintiff alleges
6 different 11116. There 6611 be many obligations between the same
parties in respect of the same subject 3 but the same subject only
admits of 0116 true dominion, and consequently of only one true
11116 10 1101616106. Hence the plaintiff in a 1661 661106 was re-
quired 10 61111666 611 1116 16661611 111166 06 11616 01 being barred by
the exception of res judicata, and if, for instance, he 6161166 owner-
ship on the ground of tradition he cannot afterwards claim by
another title, 6. g. usucapion. A man who 16116 16 6 616161 66 testa-
mentary heir may, however, afterwards claim 66 heir by descent, Dig.
5, 3, 8: he has as many actions (hereditatis petitio) as he has de-
lations: in fact the legacies 6611 1116 arbitrary division 01 1116 suc-
cession between the co-heirs make 6 testamentary inheritance quite
a different right (alia res) from an intestate inheritance. (So Ihering‚
§51· But this doctrine seems 111-6006016116 with Dig. 44, 2, 30,
pr. which is quoted by Savigny, ξ 300, 66 establishing that a man
who fails when he 6161166 66 testamentary heir cannot afterwards
claim as heir by 11666661.) The rule, of course, does not apply 10 6
11116 601 16 existence at the time of the former action (causa super-
veniens), and it is defeated if the plaintiff takes the precaution
expressly to limit the former action (probably by means of a prae-
scriptio) to the investigation of a specific title, a limitation called
causae adjectio. If he was allowed by the praetor to do this and
failed in his suit, he could afterwards claim dominion by a different
title. Si quis petat fundum suum esse, 6ο quod Titius 61116 sibi
tradiderit; si postea eum alia ex causa petat, 661166 adjecta, non
debet summoveri exceptione, Dig. 44, 2, 11, 2. ‘ A plaintiff who
loses an action in which he claimed property in land on the ground
