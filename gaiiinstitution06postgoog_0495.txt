'I'he mode of growth of Roman law and the relation between
directa Aquilia and utilis Aquilia may be illustrated by similar
phenomena in English law, and the relation between the two forms
of action called Trespass and Trespass on the Case. Trespass‚ which
lies for injury to real or persona] property or to the person, accom-
panied with violence, has a more extensive application than directa
Aquilia, but viewed only as redressing injur-ies to personal property,
is nearly coextensive in its range. The original scheme of actions,
devised in comparativcly barbarous timeS, contained no remedy for
injuries where there is no act done but only a culpable omission,
or where the aet is not immediately injnrions, but only by conse-
quence or collaterally, or where the idea of force is inapplicable
‘because the subject matter is not corporeal or tangible, although
the injury may be by act direct and immediate in its operation.

'1¹0 supply such deficiencies the statute of westminster, 13 Edward I, ’

had directed the clerks in chancer-y to frame new writs whenever
the old scheme of writs contained no remcdy for a wrong resem-
bling in its features other wrongs for which a remedy was provided.
Accordingly, a new writ of Trespass on the Case was framed upon
the analogy of the old form of Trespass (confer, ad exemplum
institoriac‚ ᾧ 162 com.) applying to cases where the injury is not
immediate, or the subject affected is not corporeal, or the agency is
not bodily force. What Edward 1. directed to be done by the
clerks in chancery, and what was done by the introduction of the
action of Trespass on the Caso, was exactly analogous to what the
praetore did when, in virtue of their judicial authority, they sup-
plemented the civil law by the introduction of actiones fictitiae and
actiones in factum. In respect of torts to personal property, the
latter have nearly the same sphere as 'Prespass on the case. The
innovatione of the praetor, however, were not confined to the
region of torts to personal property, but pervaded every sphere
and constituted a mass of supplementary law (jus praetorium),
having to the remainder of the law (jus civile) similar relations
and equal proporti ons to those which equity has to common law
in English jurisprudence.

savigny, Appendix 14, 20, gives the following as probably the
ordinary formula m anaction for damages under the lex Aquilia:
