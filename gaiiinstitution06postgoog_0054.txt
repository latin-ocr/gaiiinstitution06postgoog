the service for which they were destined and the class from which
they sprang.

Each civil century had a single vote in the Comitia Centuriata,
and from the number of centuries into which the classes were
respectively distributed, it is obvious that in this assembly the
wealthy classes had a great predominance; that is, the Comitia
centuriata was a timocratic assembly, or one in which the as-
cendency belonged to wealth‚ as the Comitia 'I'ributa was a demo-
cratic assemhly, or one in which the ascendency belonged to
numbers. 'I'he Comitia Tributa were called Plebs, the Comitia
centuriata were called Populus3 the enactments of the latter body
were called leges, the enactments of the former were called ple-
bisciteS.

'l'he subsequent stages in the growth of the commonalty and the

legislative measures which demand our consideration.

Bc. 449, a lex Valeria Horatia, passed after a second secession

ΒΕ. 28⁷, a lex Hortensia, passed after a secession of the plebs to
the Janiculum, enacted, Ut eo jure quod plebs statuisset omnes
Quirites tenerentur, Gellius, 15, 27, ‘ that plebiscites should bind
all Quirites?

'Phe interpretation of these apparently identical and, as it seems,
imperfectly recited laws, appears to be as follows 2—-

By the lex Valeria Horatia the Comitia Tributa received a legis-
lative initiative, but, to have force of law, the enactments required
to be confirmed by the vote of Comitia Centuriata (Comitia Curiata,
according to Niebuhr) and sanctioned by the auctoritas of the
Senate. ·
