111. ξς 97-109.] PAYMENT TO A THIRD PERSON. 387

0116 name with a third person, aud then ceded his right of action
to his principa13 that is, made his principal his mandatary: the
principal then sued and recovered on the stipulation as Cessionary
of the action, that 16, 66 mandatary of his mandatary. In the latest
period the actual Cession of the action was unnecessary: the praetor
· allowed the principal to sue by an actio Utilis, 1. 6. 66 action whose
formula contained a Fiction, with whose precise nature we are
unacquaiuted‚ but perhaps to the effect that the principal was the
universal successor of the agent. In respect of Formless contracts‚
or contracts governed by J us Gentium, the institute of Agency
was more completely recognized. If an Agent merely acted as
emissary (nuncius) and instrument (minister) of 1116 11116611161, 11161
16, contracted in the name of his principal‚ the principal acquired
an immediate right against the third contractor and incurred a
direct obligation to him: he could sue him 01 116 sued by him
in an actio Directa—he was not driven to an actio Utilis or
Fictitia. In this respect the distinction between Formal and
Formless contracte may 116 thus expressed: in Formal contracte
the Civil law requires both elements of the Title or Disposition,
the 666661161 61616661 (161661106 10 616616 66 obligation> and the
symbolic clement (the declaratory question or answer) to 116 6616 of
the same person: in Formless contracts Gentile law allows these
elements to be sundered3 allows the essential part (intention) to
be the act of one person, the Principal, and the declaratory part
(the formless external manifestation of this intention) to 116 1116
act of another person, the Agent.

If then it was desired to contract for payment to 6 third person, it
was only necessary that the contractor should not attempt to do 66
11116611161 what he could only do as agent, or to do without Cession
what could only be done by means of Cession. Even if he neglected
these precautions it did not inevitably follow that his contract was
inefficacious. Paulus, indeed, Dig. 44, 7, 11, lays down the principle
which we have already, ξ 100, noticed: ‘Every disposition in which
a person contracte 66 principa] but attempts to entitle a third
person to sue as principa] (i.e. attempts to invest a third person
with the rights of an immediate creditor> is invalid: and neither
by formal conti-act of stipulation‚ nor by formless contract of
purchase and sale, nor by any other contract in which I am prin·
611161 can Ι invest a third person with a right to sue in his own
1161663 But this rule was not so important as 61 first sight it
