472 DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. [111. ἕξ 210-219.

ᾗ 213. The owner of a murdered slave both had a civil remedy
ΒΥ the lex Aquilia, and could prosecute criminally under the lex
Cornelia de sicariis, passed in the dictatorship of Sylla, B.c. 80.

ξ 215. The lex Aquilia, like many other Roman laws, combined
heterogeneous dispositione. The first and third chapters contain
remedies for destruction of property, or jus in rem, that ie, the
injury of what is called in English law a chose in possession3 the
second chapter contains a remedy for the destruction of an obliga-
tion, or jus in personam, that is, the injury of what is called in
English law, a chose in action. The power of one promisee, the
adstipulator, to extingnish by acceptilation the right of the other
promisee, the principal stipulator, was a consequence of their
Correality, 3 ᾗ 110, commentary.

ξ 217. 'Phe terms of the third chapter are preserved in the
Digest: Ceterarum rerum, praeter hominem et pecudem occisos,
si quis alteri damnum faxit, quod usserit, fregerit, ruperit injuria,
quanti ea res fuit in diebus triginta proximis, tantum aes domino
dare damnas estc, Dig. 9, 2 ; 27, 5.. ‘ For property, other than
slave or cattle slain, damaged ΒΥ buming, breaking, crushing,
unlawfully, the value it bore in the thirty days preceding shall be ι
due as a judgment debt from the offender to the owner.’

ξ 219. An action founded on the text of a law was called actio
directa, an action not founded on the very text of the law, but
granted ΒΥ the praetor in the exercise of his judicial authority in
circumstances which, though different, are similar to those which
founded the direct action, was called actio utilis. The direct Aquilian
action could only be brought when damage was immediately caused
ΒΥ a body to a body. If the damage was not caused by a body, or
not by immediate content, only the actio utilis could be brought.

'Phe actio utilis was some modification of the actio directa, to which
it apparently contained a reference, though the precise nature of
the modification and the exact terms of the reference have not been
handed down. In a case of damage where neither the agent nor the
patient was a body, neither directa Aquilia nor utilis Aquilia could
be maintained, but only actio in factum, Inst. 4, 3, 16. The actio in Ἰ
factum was a still further departure from the act-io directa, to which
it contained no reference, and indeed was not necessarily related to
any actio directa. It was so named because the formula merely pro-
posed a matter of fact (si paret fecisse) to be verified by the judex,
and, in the event of an affirmative finding, directed a condemnation.
