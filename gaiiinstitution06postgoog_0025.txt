PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS. ' 3

whom it is onerous, that is, to whom it is commanded, by an appeal
to the sovereign power to whom such person is subject.

Dealing at present with the Civil code, we shall confine ourselves,
in treating of Rights, to rights of subject against subject, that is,
to rights which imply a common superior. Whether a sovereigri
can have rights against his own subject, whether, that is, the con-
ception of rights permits the same person to be party and sove-
reigu, is a question that may be left to the theory of the Political
code. The question whether a sovereign, in his civil courts of
judicatum, shall accord rights to a foreign potentate, that is, to ono
who owes him no allegiance, may be left to the theory of the
salutary but sanctionless code called the Comity of nations.

Tit-le is the fact, event, or circumstance defining or designating
the person on whom the lawgiver confers a right or on whom
he imposes an obligation. The word Title is employed in a limited
application by English lawyers, to denote the mode of acquiring a
Real right3 but we use it without any limitation to any branch
of law, to denote universally the fact originating any right, real
or personal, and not only to denote the fact originating any right,
but also the fact originating any obligation, civil or crimina13 nay,
further, not only to denote the mode in which any right, or obliga-
tion is originated, or begins, but also to denote the mode in which
any right or obligation is terminated or comes to an end. To use
the nomenclature of Bentham, a 'Pitle is a fact Collocative¹ of Rights
and Obligations. The generic term Collocative splits into Investi-
tive and Divestitive. Title, then, is a fact Investitive or Divestitive
of Rights and Obligations. Investitive again splits into Collative
and Impositive, and Divestitive into Privative and Exonerative.
Title, then, definitively, is any fact Collative or Privative of a
Right and Impositive or Exonerative of an Obligation.

Every Rjght implies a Law by which it is created, a Title to
which it is annexed, a Sovereign by whom it is enforced, a Sanction
by means of which it is enforced, a person in whom it resides, and
a person on whom a correlative obligation is incumbent. The same,
mutatis mutandis, may be said of every relative Obligation. We
say of every relative obligation, for not all obligations are relative.
obligations are either relative or absolute ; relative are those which
imply a private person invested with a corresponding right, absolute

¹ As the term Disposition is presently used in a narrower sense, the term Colloca-
tive has been substituted for Bentham’s term Dispositive.
