their nature contemplate a certain delay in performance. In such
,ι contracte 116 1101(]6 that prescription begins not from the com-
pletion of the contract but from the demand of performance.

It seems paradoxical 130 maintain that for the purposes of pre-
scription the right of action precedes the existence of 6 wrong:

ι but Vangerow’ s doctrine 1s confirmed by the Digest: Est scriptum

. . eum qui rem deposuit, statim posse depositi actione agere:
hoc enim ipso dolo facere eum qui suscepit, quod reposcenti rem
non reddat, Dig. 16, 3, 22 3 from which it appears that the action
is equivalent to a demand. Similarly we read in the Institutione,
3, 15, 2 [Ex stipulatione pura] confestim peti potest. Indeed it
would be strange, as Vangerow obser-vce, if the neglect of a creditor
or his successor to demand repayment for 100 years adjourned the
inception of prescription for all that period.

Itis clear that the Nativitx pf 611 66131011 16 not to be identified
with Mora, but will often be an earlier occurrence. Mora, which
in respect of interest and liubility for loss 16 attended with serious
consequences 10 a defendant (whereas praescriptio is adverse 10 13116
, plaintiff), does not arise before one of 111-,6 61161116, either the ‘expi-
16131011 of the term prefixed for payment, or'⁶ the debtor’s refusal
to comply with the creditor's demand. The demand of the creditor
is necessary to disprove the presumption that the delay of pay-
ment was by his indulgence. no such condition delays the nativity
of a right of action.

The other limit of Prescription, or the event by which it is
broken (interruptio), is any recognition of a right by the defendant
or the institution of a suit by the plaintiff. 'lhe institution of 6
611113 was in earlier times identified with Litis contestatio. but in
the la·est period, 66 this stage of procedure couldfflbe ,(1616γώ by the
arts 01 the defendant, it was necessary 130 fix some other point.
And accordingly Citation, awarded by the judge in response to
the libellus of the 111611111ίῖ and served upon the defendant (111-

sinuatio conventio) by a public officer, was deemed to be the
moment at which an action commences, and prescription is in·

Vangerow admits that citat-,ion is the event which interrupte
