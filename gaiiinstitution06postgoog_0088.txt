66 DE PERSONIS. [1. ξ 55.

66 you state that you sold your freeborn children.’ J ustinian in-
creased the penalties of the law against creditore who took posses-
sion of the freeborn child of a debtor as a security for a debt. He
enacted that the creditor should forfeit the debt, should pay an
equal sum to the child or parent, aud in addition should undergo
corporal punishment, Novella, 134, 7. In the time of Gaius, the
only genuine sale of a child into bondage was in the case of noxal
surrender, i.e. when a father sued for the trespass of a child, in lieu
of damages, surrendered his delinquent son or daughter as a bonds-
man (mancipium) to the plaintiff, ᾧ 140. 'Phe sale of the child 16
adoption and emancipation was merely fictitious 3 even noxal
surrender was practically obsolete in the time of J ustinian, by
whom it was formally abolished, Inst. 4, 8, ’7. Constantine, how-
ever, in cases of extreme poverty permitted parents to sell their
children immediately after birth (sanguinolentos), and this oon·
stitution was retained in the code of J ustinian, Cod. 4, 43, 2.

2. In respect of property, filiusfamilias was capable of obligation
but not of right3 he could be debtor but not creditor; in any
transaction where 66 independent person (sui juris) would have
been creditor, filiusfamilias was merely a conduit-pipe through
which a right vested in his father as creditor or proprietor. Even
in domestic relations filiusfamilias could only figure 66 inferior, not
as superior3 he owed obedience‚ but could not exercise command
(jus, 16 13116 special sense which it has in the phrases, sui juris, alieni
juris); he could only be an instrument by which his father acquired
a right of command. Thus, filiusfamilias had commercium, and
could take by mancipatio, but the property he thus took vested in
his father; he could make a valid eontract‚ but the contractual
right vested in his father3 he had testamentifactio, that is, he could
be witness, libripens, familiae emptor, but he could not make a will,
for he had no property to leave ς and if he took under 6 will as
legatee or 11611, 13116 legaey or succession vested in his father. He
had the other element of civitas, connubium 3 that is, he could 666-
tract 6 civil marriage and beget civil children3 but the patria
potestas over these children vested not in the father but in the
grandfather, and if the marriage was accompanied with power of
hand (manus), marital power over the wife, this vested not in the
husband but in the husband’s father. Any property which the son
was allowed by his father to manage was called his peculium, i.e.
was held on the same terms as property which a slave administered
