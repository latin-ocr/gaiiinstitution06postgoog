§76. Eorum vero bona qui, si §76. The goods of those who,
non in aliquo vitio essent, manu· but for some offence, would have
missi futuri Latini essent, proinde become on manumission Latini
tribuuntur patronis, ac si Latini J uniani devolve to their patrons
decessissent. nec me praeterit non as the goods of Latini Juniani,
satis in ea re legis latorem volun- though, as I am aware, the legis-
tatem suam verbis expressisse. lator has not expressed his intention

in this matter in terms as unequi·
vocal as might be desired.

ᾧ 59. It was an arbitrary rule of Roman jurisprudence that
rights of patronage were not divisible in unequal portions (placuit
nullam esse libertorum divisionem, Dig. 37, 14, 24), that is, that
several joint proprietors of a slave in unequal portions aequired by
his manumission equal rights as joint patrons against his succession.

ᾧ 60. The rights of patrous were modelled on those of agnates,
and we know that only the nearest agnate was entitled to suceeed.

Therefore on the decease of one of several joint patrons his rights

’ acerued to the remainder by survivorship. But the peculium of a

slave belongs to his coproprietors in the ratio of their property,
and on the decease of one, his rights do not accrue to the copro-
prietors, but are transmitted to the representatives of the deceased.

ξ 63. 'Phe Sc. Largianum was passed under the emperor ClaudiuS,
Aa). 42.

ᾧ 69. The Sc. Largianum giving a successoral right to the
children of the patron, put them all on a footing of equality like
manumitting joint proprietors, ᾧ 59, but it only took effect when
a stranger was appointed heir or coheir; if then a patron lest, his
whole inheritance to his children, but in unequal portionS, their
rights to the succession of a Latinus J unianus would be governed
by the older law, and would be proportionate to their shares in
their father’s succession.

ᾧ 75. Ulpian gives as a reason why Dediticius could not make
a will his want of citizenship both at Rome and in every other state:
Is qui dediticiorum numero est testamentum facere non potest,
quoniam nec quasi civis Romanus testari potest, cum sit peregrinus,
nec quasi peregrinuS, quoniam nullius certae civitatis civis est, ut
secundum leges civitatis suae testetur, 20, 14. This requires some
explanation 3 and the explanation may serve to illustrate all those

passages of Gaius, e. g. 1 ᾧ 92, where he alludes to the laws of civi·
tates peregrinae.
