632 DE ACTIONIBUS. [ιτ. §5 las-17⁰.

therein, shall be recoverable by action within a year3 aster the
expiration of a year he shall only recover what came into the
hands of the dispossessor.’ That is to say, the distinction between
vis armata and vis quotidiana was no longer recognized. Savigny’s
opinion, that in virtue of this constitution the interdiet Unde vi
became applicable to movables as well as to immovables, is not
generally adopted.

Although violence, armed or unarmed, was prohibited to be em-
ployed for the recovery of possession even from possessor vitiosus,
yet to repel violence by violence in the defence of possession was
permitted. Eum igitur qui cum armis veuit possumus armis repel-
lere, sed hoc confestim, non ex intervallo, dummodo sciamus non
solum resistere permissum ne dejiciatur, sed et si dejectus quis
fuerit, eundem dejicere non ex intervallo sed ex continenti posse,
Dig. 43, 16, 3, 9. ‘ An armed aggressor may be lawfully repelled
by arms, but this must be immediately, and we may not only resist
disseisim but eject the disseisor, provided that no interval has
elapsed.’ Qui possessionem vi ereptam 'vi in ipso congreoeu recu-
perat, in pristinam causam reverti potius quam vi possidere intel-
ligendus est. Ideoque si te vi dejecero, illico tu me, deiude ego te,
unde vi interdictum tibi utile erit, Ibid. 17. ‘ A possessor who is
violently disseised and recovers seisin by immediate violence, rather
restores his 'former position than possesses by violence. Therefore‚
if Ι oust you by violence, and am immediately ousted by you, and
then oust you again, you may have the interdict Unde vi.’

We have seen that Uti possidetis and Utrubi, though called in-
terdicts Retinendae possessionis, were also in effect interdicts
Recuperandae possessionis whenever any of the vitia possessionis
was established: that if the possession of the actual possessor was
tainted with one of three vices, if it was not adverse (open and
unauthorized) and commeneed without violence (vi, clam, aut
precario), then his adversary recovered possession. What, then, it
may be asked, was the use of a distinct interdict Recuperaudae
possessionis, the interdict Unde vi, which, like the Uti possidetis,

, was only available for a year ? 'Phe answer is, that Uti possidetis

only restored possession when the dispossessor was in present poe
session, it gave no redress when a third party was the present
possessor: in such cases the party dispossessed required a different
remedy, and this was given him in the intel-diet Unde vi. Fui-ther,
by Uti possidetis the intermediate ‚profits (fructus) were only re-
