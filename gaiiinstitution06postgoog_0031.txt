PRELIMINARY' DEFINITIONS. 9

flicted on him by the irresistible power of the sovereign. The
sanction of the primary obligation is the secondary obligatiou‚ and
it is imaginable that the sanction of the secondary obligation
should be a tertiary obligation, and so on3 but this series of sanc-
tioned and sanctioning obligations cannot proceed without a limit:
if it did, every sanction might be defied and every obligation
broken, and there would be no ultimate basis of obligation. But,
in fact, the series comes to a speedy end. When once the secondary
obligation is ascertained by a J udgment or Condemnation, unless
this judgment is satisfied by a voluntary submission of the party
condemned, the ultimate sanction soon quits the form of obligation,
and presents itself in the shape of Execution, that ie, of physical
compulsion, to which the assent of the party obliged is immaterial.
Indeed, in the criminal code we can scarcely speak of primary and
secondary obligation, as the sanction usually in the first instance
assumes the form of physical compulsion.

One species of 'l'itles and the most important deserves a more
particular consideration—the Titles which consist of human action.

Human acts are either lawful or unlawful. All unlawsul acts of
course are titles, that ie, ori ginate obligations, whether as contra-
vening the Civil code they are Tort3‚ or as contravening the
Crimina] code they are Crimes.

Of lawful acts only those are titles, or originate obligatione,
which are desig-ned to produce this effect, and these actions are
called by the distinctive name of DispositionS. Dispositions (the
Rechtsgeschaefte of the Germane), then, are permitted actions in-
tended to generate or extinguish obligations. Dispositions such
as Testation or Bequest, to make which a single person is com-
petent, may be called unilateral: Dispositions such as Contract and
Alienation, which require the concurrence of two persons (promissor
acceptor, grantor grantee) who take opposite parts, may be called
bilateral.

Let us consider some of the contrasts of Wrongful acts (torte or
crimes) and DispositionS.

A Disposition produces in the first place a primary obligation:
a Wrong produces in the first place a secondary obligation.

Every Disposition involves Intention: a wrong may involve
either Intention or Negligence.

Both in Wrongs and in Dispositions the Intention must be
accompanied by some external act: the mere intention to offend is
