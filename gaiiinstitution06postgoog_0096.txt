as are specially privileged3 and, before the lex Papia Poppoea was
passed, a freeborn citizen (ingenuus) had no oonnubium with a
citizen by manumission (libertinus). Lege Papia cavetur omnibus
ingenuis praeter senatores eorumque liberos libertinam uxorem
habere licere, Dig. 23, 2, 23. ‘ 'Phe lex Papia permits all freeborn
citizens, except senators and their children, to marry freedwomen.'

ᾇ 58. The prohibition of marriage between collateral relatione,
originally perhaps extended as far as there were legal names for
the relationship, i. e. as far as the sixth degree, for Tacitus men-
tions that second cousins were once incapable of intel-marriage,
sobrinarum diu ignorata matrimonia, Ann. 12, 6, the prohibition
was subsequently reduced to the fourth degree, i. e. to the inter-
marriage of first cousins (consobrini), Ulpian, 5, 63 and finally to
the third degree3 with this restrictiori, however, that if one of the
collaterale was only removed by one degree from the common
ancestor (stipes eommunis), he was regarded as a quasi ascendent
(loco parentis) and incapable of intermarriage at any degree: thus,
a man could not marry his brother’ s or sister' s granddaughter,
though only related in the fourth degree, Cod. 5, 4, 13. Degrees
in the direct line were reckoned by counting the generations or
births to which a person owed his descent from an ancestor: thus,
a man is one degree from his father, two from his grandfather:
in the transverse or collateral line, by adding the degrees which
separate each collateral from the common stook, · thus, a man is
two degrees from his sister, three from his niece.

riage with a brother' s daughter as incestuouS, Cod. Theod. l, 2.

ξ 63. Allianoe (affinitas) ιε the relationship of a person to the kin
(cognates) of a sponse. The husband is allied to the kin of the wife,
the wife to the kin of the husband ; but there is no allianee between
the kin of the husband and the kin of the wife. 'I'he following are
some of the names given to these relationships. In the ascending
line the father and mother of the wife or husband are socer and
socrus (father-in-law, mother-in-law), and in relation to them the
husband of the daughter and wife of the son are gener and nurus
(son-in-law, daughter-in-law). ’In the descending line the children
of the sponse are privignus and privigna (step-son, step-daughter),
and in relation to them the husband of the mother and the wife
of the father are vitricus and noverea (step-father and step-mother).
In the collateral line the husband’s brother is levir (brother-in-law),
