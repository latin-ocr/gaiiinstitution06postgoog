bunes, quaestore, in outward form elected by the people; and the
imperial nominees with much greater real authority, under the
name of praefecti, the praefectus urbi, praefectus praetorio, prae-
fectus vigilum, praefectus annonae, praefectus aerari03 for though
nominally the people and princeps had their separate treasuries

under the name of aerarium and fiscus, yet the treasury of the ,

people was not managed by quaestors as in the time of the
republic, but by an official appointed by the emperor. Similarly
the provinces were divided between the people and the prince,
the people administering those which were peaceful and unwarlike,
the prince those which required the presence of an army. 'Phe
governor of a province, whether of the people or the emperor, was
called Praeses Provinciae, though the title properly belonged to
the governor of an imperial province. The Praeses of a popular
province was a Proconsul, and the chief subordinate functionaries
were Legati, to whom was delegated the civil jurisdiction, and
quaestore, who exercised a jurisdiction corresponding to that of
the ediles in Rome. 'Phe emperor himself was in theory the Pro-
consul of an imperial province ; but the actual governor, coordi-
nate with the Proconsul of a senatorial province, was the Legatus
Caesaris, while the financial administration and fiscal jurisdiction
were committed to a functionary called Procurator Caesaris, instead
of the republican Quaestor. Sometimes the same person united
thc office of Procurator and Legatus, as, for instance, Pontius
Pilate. ,

ᾧ 7. The opinions of a jurist had originally only the weight that
was due to his knowledge and genius3 but on the transfer of
sovereign power from the hands of the people to those of a monarch,
the latter recognized the expediency of being able to direct and
inspire the oracles of jurisprudence3 and accordingly Augustus
converted the profession of jurist into a sort of political function,
giving the decisions of certain authorized jurists the force of law,
intending, doubtless, that the blue ribbon of the profession should
never be conferred on any lawyer who had antiquarian notions of
constitutional law, or whose instincte did not make hini a zealous
propagandist of the doctrines of despotism. Ante tempora Augusti !
publice respondendi jus non a principibus dabatur, sed qui fiduciam
studiorum suorum habebant, consulentibus respondebant. Neque
responsa utique signata dabant, sed plerumque judicibus ipsi scribe-
bant aut testabantur qui illos consulebant. Primus divus Augustus,
