PRELIMINABY DEFINITIONS. 1 1

C is B, 6666116 11161 such actions or omissions bring these parties under
the category represented by B. The conaequent rights or duties of
such individual persons are expressed in the conclusion, C is A.

Resuming now our 601611611606 of Wrongs and Dispositions, but
confining ourselves to intentional wrong (dolus), we observe that
both in Wrongs and in Dispositions the middle term B of the above
syllogism is intended (66 object of the intention of the offender
or 1116110661 C) ε only in Dispositions the major term A as well 66
1116 middle term B is intended. The wrongdoer desii-es, purposes
and intends an event which happens 10 116 066 of the Titles B in
the penal eod03 but, though undeterred by the menaee of the
legislator, by no means desires or intends the consequences A which
that code annexes to B. These, on the contrary, he wishes and
hopes to avoid. The major term intended in the syllogism which
instigates his 661106 16 60616 other motive, some pecnniary ad-
vantage, or some pleasure to be gained, or some painful passion
to 116 assuaged. In a Disposition, on the contrary, the law, the
major premiss, B is A, of the forensic syllogism‚ is a premiss in the
practieal syllogism which determined the disposer 10 1116 step he
takes. His immediate intention is to bring himself under the
category B, a Title of the civil code3 bnt 116 only cares for B as 66
instrument or means 10 601116 legal 6611, 66 6 valid Title whereby he

intent is by means of Β 10 link himself or some other person to 1116
category A.

Both in Wrongs and in Dispositions, to constitute a perfect 'I'itle
that shall generate 66 obligation‚ there must be 611 6660111 between
the intention and the external manifestation. In dolose Wrong the
intention must accord with 1116 overt act: in unilateral Disposition
the intention 1111161 6660111 with the Declaration: in 1111616161 Dis-
position 111616 161161 116 6 further accord between the 1616611066 of
the two disposers; the intention of the promissor must accord with
that of the promissee3 the intention of the alienor must accord
with that of the 61161166.

From the preceding it appears that the theory both of Wrongs
and of Dispositions must be based on a precise conception of the
nature of Intention. Intentional wrongs, however, are not the sole
means by which a person incurs penal obligation. 'I'he acts im-
posing secondary obligations are said to be imputable‚ and for such
6616 the agent is said to ·be liable, answerable‚ responsible, ac-
